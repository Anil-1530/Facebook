# Introduction <img src="fairseq_logo.png" width="50"> 

Fairseq(-py) is a sequence modeling toolkit that allows researchers and
developers to train custom models for translation, summarization, language
modeling and other text generation tasks. It provides reference implementations
of various sequence-to-sequence models, including:
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**
  - [Dauphin et al. (2017): Language Modeling with Gated Convolutional Networks](examples/language_model/conv_lm/README.md)
  - [Gehring et al. (2017): Convolutional Sequence to Sequence Learning](examples/conv_seq2seq/README.md)
  - [Edunov et al. (2018): Classical Structured Prediction Losses for Sequence to Sequence Learning](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/tree/classic_seqlevel)
  - [Fan et al. (2018): Hierarchical Neural Story Generation](examples/stories/README.md)
  - **_New_** [wav2vec: Unsupervised Pre-training for Speech Recognition (Schneider et al., 2019)](examples/wav2vec/README.md)
- **LightConv and DynamicConv models**
  - **_New_** [Wu et al. (2019): Pay Less Attention with Lightweight and Dynamic Convolutions](examples/pay_less_attention_paper/README.md)
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks**
  - [Luong et al. (2015): Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025)
  - [Wiseman and Rush (2016): Sequence-to-Sequence Learning as Beam-Search Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.02960)
- **Transformer (self-attention) networks**
  - [Vaswani et al. (2017): Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)
  - [Ott et al. (2018): Scaling Neural Machine Translation](examples/scaling_nmt/README.md)
  - [Edunov et al. (2018): Understanding Back-Translation at Scale](examples/backtranslation/README.md)
  - **_New_** [Baevski and Auli (2018): Adaptive Input Representations for Neural Language Modeling](examples/language_model/transformer_lm/README.md)
  - **_New_** [Shen et al. (2019): Mixture Models for Diverse Machine Translation: Tricks of the Trade](examples/translation_moe/README.md)

Fairseq features:
- multi-GPU (distributed) training on one machine or across multiple machines
- fast generation on both CPU and GPU with multiple search algorithms implemented:
  - beam search
  - Diverse Beam Search ([Vijayakumar et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02424))
  - sampling (unconstrained and top-k)
- large mini-batch training even on a single GPU via delayed updates
- mixed precision training (trains faster with less GPU memory on [NVIDIA tensor cores](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensor-cores))
- extensible: easily register new models, criterions, tasks, optimizers and learning rate schedulers

We also provide [pre-trained models](#pre-trained-models-and-examples) for several benchmark
translation and language modeling datasets.

# Requirements and Installation

* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) version >= 1.0.0
* Python version >= 3.5
* For training new models, you'll also need an NVIDIA GPU and [NCCL](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl)

Please follow the instructions here to install PyTorch: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#installation.

If you use Docker make sure to increase the shared memory size either with
`--ipc=host` or `--shm-size` as command line options to `nvidia-docker run`.

After PyTorch is installed, you can install fairseq with `pip`:
```
pip install fairseq
```

**Installing from source**

To install fairseq from source and develop locally:
```
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq
cd fairseq
pip install --editable .
```

**Improved training speed**

Training speed can be further improved by installing NVIDIA's
[apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) library with the `--cuda_ext` option.
fairseq will automatically switch to the faster modules provided by apex.

# Getting Started

The [full documentation](https://fairseq.readthedocs.io/) contains instructions
for getting started, training new models and extending fairseq with new model
types and tasks.

# Pre-trained models and examples

We provide pre-trained models and pre-processed, binarized test sets for several tasks listed below,
as well as example training and evaluation commands.

- [Translation](examples/translation/README.md): convolutional and transformer models are available
- [Language Modeling](examples/language_model/README.md): convolutional models are available

We also have more detailed READMEs to reproduce results from specific papers:

          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and

      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
