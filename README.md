# <img src="fairseq_logo.png" width="30"> Introduction

Fairseq(-py) is a sequence modeling toolkit that allows researchers and
developers to train custom models for translation, summarization, language
modeling and other text generation tasks.

### What's New:

- September 2019: [Nonautoregressive translation code released](examples/nonautoregressive_translation/README.md)
- August 2019: [WMT'19 models released](examples/wmt19/README.md)
- July 2019: fairseq relicensed under MIT license
- July 2019: [RoBERTa models and code released](examples/roberta/README.md)
- June 2019: [wav2vec models and code released](examples/wav2vec/README.md)

**Additionally:**
- multi-GPU (distributed) training on one machine or across multiple machines
- fast generation on both CPU and GPU with multiple search algorithms implemented:
  - beam search
  - Diverse Beam Search ([Vijayakumar et al., 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02424))
  - sampling (unconstrained, top-k and top-p/nucleus)
- large mini-batch training even on a single GPU via delayed updates
- mixed precision training (trains faster with less GPU memory on [NVIDIA tensor cores](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensor-cores))
- extensible: easily register new models, criterions, tasks, optimizers and learning rate schedulers

We also provide [pre-trained models](#pre-trained-models-and-examples) for several benchmark
translation and language modeling datasets.

# Requirements and Installation

* [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/) version >= 1.2.0
* Python version >= 3.5
* For training new models, you'll also need an NVIDIA GPU and [NCCL](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl)
* **For faster training** install NVIDIA's [apex](https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex) library with the `--cuda_ext` option

To install fairseq:
```bash
pip install fairseq
```

On MacOS:
```bash
CFLAGS="-stdlib=libc++" pip install fairseq
```

If you use Docker make sure to increase the shared memory size either with
`--ipc=host` or `--shm-size` as command line options to `nvidia-docker run`.

**Installing from source**

To install fairseq from source and develop locally:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq
cd fairseq
pip install --editable .
```

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
