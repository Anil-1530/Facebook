What is Aclasta?
Aclasta is a solution for infusion (drip into a vein) containing the active substance zoledronic acid (5 mg/ 100 ml).
What is Aclasta used for?
Aclasta is used for the treatment of the following diseases: • osteoporosis (a disease that makes bones fragile), both in women who have been through the menopause and in men.
It is used in patients who are at risk of fracture (bone breaks), including patients who have recently broken their hip in a minor trauma, such as a fall; • Paget’ s disease of the bone, a disease where the normal process of bone growth is changed.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Aclasta used?
Aclasta is given as a 100 ml infusion, lasting at least 15 minutes.
This can be repeated once a year in patients being treated for osteoporosis.
Patients who have broken their hip should receive Aclasta at least two weeks after the operation to repair the fracture.
For Paget’ s disease, only one infusion of Aclasta is given.
The effect of the infusion lasts for a year or more.
Patients must have adequate fluids before and after treatment.
Adequate supplements of vitamin D and calcium are also recommended for all patients receiving Aclasta.
In addition, patients with Paget’ s disease should take at least 500 mg calcium twice a day for at least 10 days following treatment, and patients who have broken their hip should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 international units) by mouth or by injection into a muscle before their first infusion.
Using paracetamol or ibuprofen (anti-inflammation medicines) shortly after Aclasta can reduce symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache in the three days following the infusion.
Aclasta is not recommended for use in patients who have severe problems with their kidneys.
In the treatment of Paget’ s disease of the bone, Aclasta must only be used by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of the disease.
In women, osteoporosis is more common after the menopause, when the levels of the female hormone oestrogen 7 Westferry Circus, Canary Wharf, London E14 4HB, UK Tel.

In Paget’ s disease the bone breaks down more quickly, and when it grows back, it is weaker than normal.
The active substance in Aclasta, zoledronic acid, is a bisphosphonate.
It stops the action of the osteoclasts, the cells in the body that are involved in breaking down the bone tissue.
This leads to less bone loss in osteoporosis and less disease activity in Paget’ s disease.
How has Aclasta been studied?
Because the active substance in Aclasta is the same as the active substance in Zometa, some of the data presented for Zometa were taken into account when assessing Aclasta.
For the treatment of osteoporosis, the effects of Aclasta given once a year have been compared with those of placebo (a dummy treatment) in two main studies.
The first involved almost 8,000 elderly women with osteoporosis, looking at the number of spine and hip fractures over three years.
The second involved 2,127 men and women with osteoporosis who were aged over 50 years and had recently broken their hip, and looked at the number of fractures over up to five years.
In both studies, the patients were allowed to take other medicines for osteoporosis, but not other bisphosphonates.
In Paget’ s disease, Aclasta has been studied in a total of 357 patients in two studies, where it was compared with risedronate (another bisphosphonate) over six months.
The patients received one infusion of Aclasta or they received risedronate once a day for two months.
The main measure of effectiveness was whether blood levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (an enzyme involved in the breakdown of bone) returned to normal or fell by at least 75% of the way back to normal levels.
What benefit has Aclasta shown during the studies?
In osteoporosis, Aclasta was more effective than placebo at reducing the number of fractures.
In the study of elderly women, the risk of spine fractures was reduced by 70% in patients taking Aclasta (without any other medicines for osteoporosis) over three years, compared with those taking placebo.
There was a 41% risk reduction in hip fractures, when comparing all women taking Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis medicines) with those taking placebo.
In the study of men and women who had broken their hip, 9% of the patients receiving Aclasta had a fracture (92 out of 1,065), compared with 13% of the patients receiving placebo (139 out of 1,062).
This represents a 35% reduction in the risk of fracture in patients receiving Aclasta.
In Paget’ s disease, Aclasta was more effective than risedronate.
After six months, the proportion of patients who had responded to treatment was 95% in one study and 97% in the other, compared with 75% and 73% of the patients who received risedronate.
What is the risk associated with Aclasta?
Most side effects with Aclasta tend to occur within the first three days after infusion, becoming less common with repeated infusions.
The most common side effect with Aclasta (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) is fever.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Aclasta, see the Package Leaflet.
Aclasta should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledronic acid, to other bisphosphonates or to any of the other ingredients.
Aclasta should not be used in patients with hypocalcaemia (low blood calcium levels) or in pregnant or breast-feeding women.
As with all bisphosphonates, patients taking Aclasta may also be at risk of kidney problems, reactions at the site of infusion and osteonecrosis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.
Why has Aclasta been approved?
The Committee recommended that Aclasta be given marketing authorisation.
Which measures are being taken to ensure the safe use of Aclasta?
The company that makes Aclasta will provide educational packs for doctors who prescribe Aclasta for osteoporosis, reminding them how the medicine should be used, and similar packs for patients, which explain the medicine’ s side effects and when they should contact their doctor.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of osteoporosis • in post-menopausal women • in men at increased risk of fracture, including those with a recent low-trauma hip fracture.
Treatment of Paget’ s disease of the bone.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
For the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, the recommended dose is a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta administered once a year.
In patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture, it is recommended to give the Aclasta infusion two or more weeks after hip fracture repair (see section 5.1).
For the treatment of Paget’ s disease, Aclasta should be prescribed only by physicians with experience in treatment of Paget’ s disease of the bone.
The recommended dose is a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta.
Retreatment of Paget’ s disease: specific retreatment data are not available.
After a single treatment with Aclasta in Paget’ s disease, an extended remission period is observed in responding patients (see section 5.1).
Aclasta (5 mg in 100 ml ready-to-infuse solution) is administered via a vented infusion line and given at a constant infusion rate.
The infusion time must not be less than 15 minutes.
For information on the infusion of Aclasta, see section 6.6.
Patients must be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of Aclasta.
This is especially important for the elderly and for patients receiving diuretic therapy.
2 Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with Aclasta administration.
In addition, in patients with Paget’ s disease, it is strongly advised that adequate supplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is ensured for at least 10 days following Aclasta administration (see section 4.4).
In patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture, a loading dose of 50,000 to 125,000 IU of vitamin D given orally or via the intramuscular route is recommended prior to the first Aclasta infusion.
The incidence of post-dose symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced with the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly following Aclasta administration.
Patients with renal impairment (see section 4.4) Use of Aclasta in patients with creatinine clearance < 35 ml/ min is not recommended due to limited clinical experience in this population.
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance ≥ 35 ml/ min.
Patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2).
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) No dose adjustment is necessary since bioavailability, distribution and elimination were similar in elderly patients and younger subjects.
Children and adolescents Aclasta is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficacy.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to any bisphosphonates.
Aclasta is contraindicated for patients with hypocalcaemia (see section 4.4).
Aclasta is contraindicated during pregnancy and in breast-feeding women (see section 4.6).
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
The dose of 5 mg zoledronic acid must be administered over at least 15 minutes.
Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 35 ml/ min) due to limited clinical experience in this population.
Patients should have their serum creatinine level measured before receiving Aclasta.
Patients must be appropriately hydrated prior to administration of Aclasta.
This is especially important in the elderly and for patients receiving diuretic therapy.
Caution is indicated when Aclasta is administered in conjunction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function (e. g. aminoglycosides or diuretics that may cause dehydration), see section 4.5.
Pre-existing hypocalcaemia must be treated by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before initiating therapy with Aclasta (see section 4.3).
Other disturbances of mineral metabolism must also be effectively treated (e. g. diminished parathyroid reserve, intestinal calcium malabsorption).
Physicians should consider clinical monitoring for these patients.
3 Elevated bone turnover is a characteristic of Paget’ s disease of the bone.
Due to the rapid onset of effect of zoledronic acid on bone turnover, transient hypocalcaemia, sometimes symptomatic, may develop and is usually maximal within the first 10 days after infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).
Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with Aclasta administration.
In addition, in patients with Paget's disease, it is strongly advised that adequate supplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is ensured for at least 10 days following Aclasta administration (see section 4.2).
Patients should be informed about symptoms of hypocalcaemia and receive adequate clinical monitoring during the period of risk.
Measurement of serum calcium before infusion of Aclasta is recommended for patients with Paget´s disease.
Severe and occasionally incapacitating bone, joint and/ or muscle pain have been infrequently reported in patients taking bisphosphonates, including Aclasta.
Aclasta contains the same active substance found in Zometa (zoledronic acid), used for oncology indications, and a patient being treated with Zometa should not be treated with Aclasta.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ):
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported predominantly in patients with cancer receiving treatment regimens including bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid.
Many of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and corticosteroids.
The majority of reported cases have been associated with dental procedures such as tooth extraction.
Many had signs of local infection including osteomyelitis.
A dental examination with appropriate preventive dentistry should be considered prior to treatment with bisphosphonates in patients with concomitant risk factors (e. g. cancer, chemotherapy, corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene).
While on treatment, these patients should avoid invasive dental procedures if possible.
For patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw while on bisphosphonate therapy, dental surgery may exacerbate the condition.
For patients requiring dental procedures, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of bisphosphonate treatment reduces the risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw.
The clinical judgement of the treating physician should guide the management plan of each patient based on individual benefit/ risk assessment.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Specific drug-drug interaction studies have not been conducted with zoledronic acid.
Zoledronic acid is not systemically metabolised and does not affect human cytochrome P450 enzymes in vitro (see section 5.2).
Zoledronic acid is not highly bound to plasma proteins (approximately 43-55% bound) and interactions resulting from displacement of highly protein-bound drugs are therefore unlikely.
Zoledronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion.
Caution is indicated when Aclasta is administered in conjunction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function (e. g. aminoglycosides or diuretics that may cause dehydration).
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data on the use of zoledronic acid in pregnant women.
Studies in animals with zoledronic acid have shown reproductive toxicological effects including malformations (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
It is not known whether zoledronic acid is excreted into human breast milk.
Aclasta is contraindicated during pregnancy and in breast-feeding women (see section 4.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4 4.8 Undesirable effects
The overall percentage of patients who experienced post-dose symptoms were 44.7%, 16.7% and 10.2% after the first, second and third infusion, respectively.
Incidence of individual symptoms following the first infusion was: fever (17.1%), myalgia (7.8%), flu-like symptoms (6.7%), arthralgia (4.8%) and headache (5.1%).
The incidence of these symptoms decreased markedly with subsequent doses of Aclasta.
The majority of these symptoms occur within the first three days following Aclasta administration.
The majority of these symptoms were mild to moderate and resolved within three days of the event onset.
The percentage of patients who experienced post-dose symptoms was lower in a smaller study (19.5%, 10.4%, 10.7% after the first, second and third infusion, respectively), where prophylaxis against post-dose symptoms was used as described below.
The incidence of post-dose symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of Aclasta can be reduced with the administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly following Aclasta administration (see section 4.2).
In the HORIZON – Pivotal Fracture Trial [PFT] (see section 5.1), the overall incidence of atrial fibrillation was 2.5% (96 out of 3,862) and 1.9% (75 out of 3,852) in patients receiving Aclasta and placebo, respectively.
The rate of atrial fibrillation serious adverse events was increased in patients receiving Aclasta (1.3%) (51 out of 3,862) compared with patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 out of 3,852).
The mechanism behind the increased incidence of atrial fibrillation is unknown.
In the osteoporosis trials (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]) the pooled atrial fibrillation incidences were comparable between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%).
For atrial fibrillation serious adverse events the pooled incidences were 1.3% for Aclasta and 0.8% for placebo.
Very common (≥ 1/ 10), common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100), rare (≥ 1/ 10,000, < 1/ 1,000) adverse drug reactions are shown in Table 1.
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Class effects:
Renal dysfunction Zoledronic acid has been associated with renal dysfunction manifested as deterioration in renal function (i. e. increased serum creatinine) and in rare cases acute renal failure.
Renal dysfunction has been observed following the administration of zoledronic acid, especially in patients with pre-existing renal compromise or additional risk factors (e. g oncology patients with chemotherapy, concomitant nephrotoxic medications, severe dehydration), the majority of whom received a 4 mg dose every 3– 4 weeks, but it has been observed in patients after a single administration.
In clinical trials in osteoporosis, the change in creatinine clearance (measured annually prior to dosing) and the incidence of renal failure and impairment was comparable for both the Aclasta and placebo treatment groups over three years.
There was a transient increase in serum creatinine observed within 10 days in 1.8% of Aclasta-treated patients versus 0.8% of placebo-treated patients.
Hypocalcaemia In clinical trials in osteoporosis, approximately 0.2% of patients had notable declines of serum calcium levels (less than 1.87 mmol/ l) following Aclasta administration.
No symptomatic cases of hypocalcaemia were observed.
In the Paget’ s disease trials, symptomatic hypocalcaemia was observed in approximately 1% of patients, in all of whom it resolved.
Based on laboratory assessment, transient asymptomatic calcium levels below the normal reference range (less than 2.10 mmol/ l) occurred in 2.3% of Aclasta-treated patients in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of Aclasta-treated patients in the Paget’ s disease trials.
The frequency of hypocalcaemia was much lower following subsequent infusions.
All patients received adequate supplementation with vitamin D and calcium in the post-menopausal osteoporosis trial, the prevention of clinical fractures after hip fracture trial, and the Paget’ s disease trials (see also section 4.2).
In the trial for the prevention of clinical fractures following a recent hip fracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received a loading dose of vitamin D prior to Aclasta administration (see section 4.2).
Local reactions In a large clinical trial, local reactions at the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and/ or pain, were reported (0.7%) following the administration of zoledronic acid.
6 Osteonecrosis of the jaw Uncommonly, cases of osteonecrosis (primarily of the jaw) have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid.
Many of these patients had signs of local infection including osteomyelitis, and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients following tooth extractions or other dental surgeries.
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has multiple well documented risk factors including a diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therapies (e. g. chemotherapy, radiotherapy, corticosteroids) and co-morbid conditions (e. g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection, pre- existing dental disease).
Although causality has not been determined, it is prudent to avoid dental surgery as recovery may be prolonged (see section 4.4).
In a large clinical trial in 7,736 patients, osteonecrosis of the jaw has been reported in one patient treated with Aclasta and one patient treated with placebo.
Both cases resolved.
4.9 Overdose
There is no experience of acute intoxication with Aclasta.
Patients who have received doses higher than those recommended should be carefully monitored.
In the event of overdose leading to clinically significant hypocalcaemia, reversal may be achieved with supplemental oral calcium and/ or an intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Bisphosphonate, ATC code:
M05BA08
Mechanism of action Zoledronic acid belongs to the class of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates and acts primarily on bone.
It is an inhibitor of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption.
Pharmacodynamic effects Aclasta treatment rapidly reduced the rate of bone turnover from elevated post-menopausal levels with the nadir for resorption markers observed at 7 days, and for formation markers at 12 weeks.
Thereafter bone markers stabilised within the pre-menopausal range.
There was no progressive reduction of bone turnover markers with repeated annual dosing.
Clinical efficacy in the treatment of post-menopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years were demonstrated in post-menopausal women (7,736 women aged 65– 89 years) with either: a femoral neck bone mineral density (BMD) with a T-score ≤ – 1.5 and at least two mild or one moderate existing vertebral fracture(s); or a femoral neck BMD T-score ≤ – 2.5 with or without evidence of existing vertebral fracture(s).
85% of patients were bisphosphonate-naïve.
Women who were evaluated for the incidence of vertebral fractures did not receive concomitant osteoporosis therapy, which was allowed for women contributing to the hip and all clinical fracture evaluations.
Concomitant osteoporosis therapy included: calcitonin, raloxifene, tamoxifen, hormone replacement therapy, tibolone; but excluded other bisphosphonates.
All women received 1,000 to 1,500 mg elemental calcium and 400 to 1,200 IU of vitamin D supplements daily.
Effect on morphometric vertebral fractures Aclasta significantly decreased the incidence of one or more new vertebral fractures over three years and as early as the one year timepoint (see Table 2).

Aclasta-treated patients aged 75 years and older exhibited a 60% reduction in the risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo patients (p < 0.0001).
Effect on hip fractures Aclasta demonstrated a consistent effect over 3 years, resulting in a 41% reduction in the risk of hip fractures (95% CI, 17% to 58%).
The hip fracture event rate was 1.44% for Aclasta-treated patients compared to 2.49% for placebo-treated patients.
The risk reduction was 51% in bisphosphonate-naïve patients and 42% in patients allowed to take concomitant osteoporosis therapy.

Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) Aclasta significantly increased BMD at the lumbar spine, hip, and distal radius relative to treatment with placebo at all timepoints (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).
Treatment with Aclasta resulted in a 6.7% increase in BMD at the lumbar spine, 6.0% at the total hip, 5.1% at the femoral neck, and 3.2% at the distal radius over 3 years as compared to placebo.
Bone histology Bone biopsies were obtained from the iliac crest 1 year after the third annual dose in 152 post- menopausal patients with osteoporosis treated with Aclasta (N=82) or placebo (N=70).
Histomorphometric analysis showed a 63% reduction in bone turnover.
In patients treated with Aclasta, no osteomalacia, marrow fibrosis or woven bone formation was detected.
Microcomputed
8 tomography (μ CT) analysis demonstrated increased trabecular bone volume and preservation of trabecular bone architecture in patients treated with Aclasta compared to placebo.
Bone turnover markers Bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), serum N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (P1NP) and serum beta-C-telopeptides (b-CTx) were evaluated in subsets ranging from 517 to 1,246 patients at periodic intervals throughout the study.
Treatment with a 5 mg annual dose of Aclasta significantly reduced BSAP by 30% relative to baseline at 12 months which was sustained at 28% below baseline levels at 36 months.
P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below baseline levels at 12 months and was sustained at 52% below baseline levels at 36 months.
B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below baseline levels at 12 months and was sustained at 55% below baseline levels at 36 months.
During this entire time period bone turnover markers were within the pre-menopausal range at the end of each year.
Repeat dosing did not lead to further reduction of bone turnover markers.
Effect on height In the three-year osteoporosis study standing height was measured annually using a stadiometer.
The Aclasta group revealed approximately 2.5 mm less height loss compared to placebo (95% CI:
1.6 mm, 3.5 mm) [p < 0.0001].
Days of disability Aclasta significantly reduced the mean days of limited activity and the days of bed rest due to back pain by 17.9 days and 11.3 days respectively compared to placebo and significantly reduced the mean days of limited activity and the days of bed rest due to fractures by 2.9 days and 0.5 days respectively compared to placebo (all p < 0.01).
Clinical efficacy in the treatment of osteoporosis in patients at increased risk of fracture after a recent hip fracture (RFT) The incidence of clinical fractures, including vertebral, non-vertebral and hip fractures, was evaluated in 2,127 men and women aged 50-95 years (mean age 74.5 years) with a recent (within 90 days) low- trauma hip fracture who were followed for an average of 2 years on study medication.
Approximately 42% of patients had a femoral neck BMD T-score below -2.5 and approximately 45% of the patients had a femoral neck BMD T-score above -2.5.
Aclasta was administered once a year, until at least 211 patients in the study population had confirmed clinical fractures.
Vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but a loading dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 IU orally or via the intramuscular route) was given to the majority of patients 2 weeks prior to infusion.
All participants received 1,000 to 1,500 mg of elemental calcium plus 800 to 1,200 IU of vitamin D supplementation per day.
Ninety-five percent of the patients received their infusion two or more weeks after the hip fracture repair and the median timing of infusion was approximately six weeks after the hip fracture repair.
The primary efficacy variable was the incidence of clinical fractures over the duration of the study.
Effect on all clinical fractures The incidence rates of key clinical fracture variables are presented in Table 4.

The study was not designed to measure significant differences in hip fracture, but a trend was seen towards reduction in new hip fractures.
All cause mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the Aclasta-treated group compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.
This corresponds to a 28% reduction in the risk of all cause mortality (p=0.01).
The incidence of delayed hip fracture healing was comparable between Aclasta (34 [3.2%]) and placebo (29 [2.7%]).
Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study Aclasta treatment significantly increased BMD at the total hip and femoral neck relative to treatment with placebo at all timepoints.
Treatment with Aclasta resulted in an increase in BMD of 5.4% at the total hip and 4.3% at the femoral neck over 24 months as compared to placebo.
Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON-RFT study 508 men were randomised into the study and 185 patients had BMD assessed at 24 months.
At 24 months a similar significant increase of 3.6% in total hip BMD was observed for patients treated with Aclasta as compared to the effects observed in post-menopausal women in the HORIZON-PFT study.
The study was not powered to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in men treated with Aclasta versus 8.7% for placebo.
In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308) an annual infusion of Aclasta was non-inferior to weekly alendronate for the percentage change in lumbar spine BMD at month 24 relative to baseline.
Clinical efficacy in the treatment of Paget’ s disease of the bone Aclasta was studied in male and female patients aged above 30 years with primarily mild to moderate Paget’ s disease of the bone (median serum alkaline phosphatase level 2.6– 3.0 times the upper limit of the age-specific normal reference range at the time of study entry) confirmed by radiographic evidence.
The efficacy of one infusion of 5 mg zoledronic acid versus daily doses of 30 mg risedronate for 2 months was demonstrated in two 6-month comparative trials.
After 6 months, Aclasta showed 96% (169/ 176) and 89% (156/ 176) response and serum alkaline phosphatase (SAP) normalisation rates compared to 74% (127/ 171) and 58% (99/ 171) for risedronate (all p < 0.001).
In the pooled results, a similar decrease in pain severity and pain interference scores relative to baseline were observed over 6 months for Aclasta and risedronate.
10 Patients who were classified as responders at the end of the 6 month core study were eligible to enter an extended follow-up period.
Of the 143 Aclasta-treated patients and 107 risedronate-treated patients who entered an extended observation study, after a median duration of follow-up of 18 months from time of dosing, 141 Aclasta-treated patients maintained their therapeutic response compared to 71 risedronate-treated patients.
This corresponds to a 96% reduction of risk of relapse in Aclasta versus risedronate-treated patients.
Bone histology was evaluated in 7 patients with Paget’ s disease 6 months after treatment with 5 mg zoledronic acid.
Bone biopsy results showed bone of normal quality with no evidence of impaired bone remodelling and no evidence of mineralisation defects.
These results were consistent with biochemical marker evidence of normalisation of bone turnover.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Single and multiple 5 and 15-minute infusions of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg zoledronic acid in 64 patients yielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which were found to be dose independent.
After initiation of the zoledronic acid infusion, plasma concentrations of the active substance increased rapidly, achieving their peak at the end of the infusion period, followed by a rapid decline to < 10% of peak after 4 hours and < 1% of peak after 24 hours, with a subsequent prolonged period of very low concentrations not exceeding 0.1% of peak levels.
Intravenously administered zoledronic acid is eliminated by a triphasic process: rapid biphasic disappearance from the systemic circulation, with half-lives of t½α 0.24 and t½β 1.87 hours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t½γ 146 hours.
There was no accumulation of the active substance in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days.
The early disposition phases (α and β, with t½ values above) presumably represent rapid uptake into bone and excretion via the kidneys.
Zoledronic acid is not metabolised and is excreted unchanged via the kidney.
Over the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine, while the remainder is principally bound to bone tissue.
From the bone tissue it is released very slowly back into the systemic circulation and eliminated via the kidney.
The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l/ h, independent of dose, and unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.
The inter- and intra-subject variation for plasma clearance of zoledronic acid was shown to be 36% and 34%, respectively.
Increasing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a 30% decrease in zoledronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the plasma concentration versus time curve.
No specific drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with zoledronic acid.
Since zoledronic acid is not metabolised in humans and the substance was found to have little or no capacity as a direct- acting and/ or irreversible metabolism-dependent inhibitor of P450 enzymes, zoledronic acid is unlikely to reduce the metabolic clearance of substances which are metabolised via the cytochrome P450 enzyme systems.
Zoledronic acid is not highly bound to plasma proteins (approximately 43-55% bound) and binding is concentration independent.
Therefore, interactions resulting from displacement of highly protein-bound drugs are unlikely.
Special populations (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of zoledronic acid was correlated with creatinine clearance, renal clearance representing 75 ± 33% of the creatinine clearance, which showed a mean of 84 ± 29 ml/ min (range 22 to 143 ml/ min) in the 64 patients studied.
Small observed increases in AUC(0-24hr), by about 30% to 40% in mild to moderate renal impairment, compared to a patient with normal renal function, and lack of accumulation of drug with multiple doses irrespective of renal function, suggest that dose adjustments of zoledronic acid in mild (Clcr = 50– 80 ml/ min) and moderate renal impairment down to a creatinine clearance of 35 ml/ min are not necessary.
As only limited data are available in severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min), no dosing recommendations are possible for this population.
11 5.3 Preclinical safety data
Acute toxicity The highest non-lethal single intravenous dose was 10 mg/ kg body weight in mice and 0.6 mg/ kg in rats.
In the single-dose dog infusion studies, 1.0 mg/ kg (6 fold the recommended human therapeutic exposure based on AUC) administered over 15 minutes was well tolerated with no renal effects.
Subchronic and chronic toxicity In the intravenous infusion studies, renal tolerability of zoledronic acid was established in rats when given 0.6 mg/ kg as 15-minute infusions at 3-day intervals, six times in total (for a cumulative dose that corresponded to AUC levels about 6 times the human therapeutic exposure) while five 15-minute infusions of 0.25 mg/ kg administered at 2– 3-week intervals (a cumulative dose that corresponded to 7 times the human therapeutic exposure) were well tolerated in dogs.
In the intravenous bolus studies, the doses that were well-tolerated decreased with increasing study duration:
0.2 and 0.02 mg/ kg daily was well tolerated for 4 weeks in rats and dogs, respectively but only 0.01 mg/ kg and 0.005 mg/ kg in rats and dogs, respectively, when given for 52 weeks.
Longer-term repeat administration at cumulative exposures sufficiently exceeding the maximum intended human exposure produced toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and liver, and at the site of intravenous administration.
The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.
The most frequent finding in the repeat-dose studies consisted of increased primary spongiosa in the metaphyses of long bones in growing animals at nearly all doses, a finding that reflected the compound’ s pharmacological antiresorptive activity.
Reproduction toxicity Teratology studies were performed in two species, both via subcutaneous administration.
Teratogenicity was observed in rats at doses ≥ 0.2 mg/ kg and was manifested by external, visceral and skeletal malformations.
Dystocia was observed at the lowest dose (0.01 mg/ kg body weight) tested in rats.
No teratological or embryo/ foetal effects were observed in rabbits, although maternal toxicity was marked at 0.1 mg/ kg due to decreased serum calcium levels.
Mutagenicity and carcinogenic potential Zoledronic acid was not mutagenic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity testing did not provide any evidence of carcinogenic potential.

1.
WHAT ACLASTA IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Aclasta is given as a single infusion into a vein by a doctor or nurse.
It belongs to a group of medicines called bisphosphonates and is used to treat osteoporosis in post-menopausal women, osteoporosis in men and Paget’ s disease of the bone.
Osteoporosis Osteoporosis is a disease that involves the thinning and weakening of the bones and is common in women after the menopause, but can also occur in men.
At the menopause, a woman’ s ovaries stop producing the female hormone oestrogen, which helps keep bones healthy.
Following the menopause bone loss occurs, bones become weaker and break more easily.
Many patients with osteoporosis have no symptoms but they are still at risk of breaking bones because osteoporosis has made their bones weaker.
Decreased circulating levels of sex hormones, mainly oestrogens converted from androgens, also play a role in the more gradual bone loss observed in men.
In both women and men, Aclasta strengthens the bone and therefore makes it less likely to break.
Because Aclasta works for a long time, you will not need another dose of Aclasta for a year.
Paget’ s disease of the bone It is normal that old bone is removed and is replaced with new bone material.
This process is called remodelling.
In Paget’ s disease, bone remodelling is too rapid and new bone is formed in a disordered fashion, which makes it weaker than normal.
If the disease is not treated, bones may become deformed and painful, and may break.
Aclasta works by returning the bone remodelling process to normal, securing formation of normal bone, thus restoring strength to the bone.
2.
BEFORE YOU ARE GIVEN ACLASTA
Follow all instructions given to you by your doctor carefully before you are given Aclasta.
You should not be given Aclasta
- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to zoledronic acid, other bisphosphonates or any of the other
ingredients of Aclasta.
- if you have hypocalcaemia (this means that the levels of calcium in your blood are too low).
- if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.
- if you are breast-feeding.
26 Take special care with Aclasta Tell your doctor before you are given Aclasta:
- if you are being treated with Zometa, which contains the same active substance as Aclasta.
- if you have a kidney problem, or used to have one.
- if you are unable to take daily calcium supplements.
- if you have had some or all of the parathyroid glands in your neck surgically removed.
- if you have had sections of your intestine removed.
- if you had or have pain, swelling or numbness of the jaw or a loosening of the tooth.
If you are under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery, tell your dentist that you are being treated with Aclasta.
Aclasta is not recommended for anyone under 18 years of age.
The use of Aclasta in children and adolescents has not been studied.
Taking other medicines Please tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
It is especially important for your doctor to know if you are taking any medicines known to be harmful to your kidneys.
Using Aclasta with food and drink Make sure you drink enough fluids (at least one or two glasses) before and after the treatment with Aclasta, as directed by your doctor.
This will help to prevent dehydration.
You may eat normally on the day you are treated with Aclasta.
Elderly patients (age 65 years and over) Aclasta can be given to older patients.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding You should not be given Aclasta if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant.
You should not be given Aclasta if you are breast-feeding.
Ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines Aclasta has no known effects on the ability to drive or use machines.
3.
HOW ACLASTA IS GIVEN
Osteoporosis The usual dose is 5 mg given as one infusion per year into a vein by your doctor or nurse.
The infusion will take at least 15 minutes.
In case you recently broke your hip, it is recommended that Aclasta is administered two or more weeks after your hip repair surgery.
Follow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor or nurse.
It is important to take calcium and vitamin D supplements (for example tablets) as directed by your doctor.
For osteoporosis, Aclasta works for one year and you will need the next dose after one year.
27 Paget’ s disease The usual dose is 5 mg, given to you as one single infusion into a vein by your doctor or nurse.
The infusion will take at least 15 minutes.
As Aclasta works for a long time, you may not need another dose of Aclasta for a year or longer.
Follow carefully all instructions given to you by your doctor or nurse.
Your doctor may advise you to take calcium and vitamin D supplements (e. g. tablets) for at least the first ten days after being given Aclasta.
It is important that you follow this advice carefully so that the level of calcium in your blood does not become too low in the period after the infusion.
Your doctor will inform you regarding the symptoms associated with hypocalcaemia.
For Paget’ s disease Aclasta may work for longer than one year, and your doctor will let you know if you need to be treated again.
If a dose of Aclasta is missed Contact your doctor or hospital as soon as possible to re-schedule your appointment.
Before stopping Aclasta therapy If you are considering stopping Aclasta treatment, please go to your next appointment and discuss this with your doctor.
Your doctor will advise you and decide how long you should be treated with Aclasta.
If you have any questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Aclasta can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
In most cases, no specific treatment is required.
Side effects related to the first infusion are very common (occurring in more than 30% of patients) but are less common following subsequent infusions.
The majority of the side effects, such as fever and chills, pain in the muscles or joints, and headache, occur within the first three days following the dose of Aclasta.
The symptoms are usually mild to moderate and go away within three days.
Your doctor can recommend a mild pain reliever such as ibuprofen or paracetamol to reduce these side effects.
The chance of experiencing these side effects decreases with subsequent doses of Aclasta.
Irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation) has been seen in patients receiving Aclasta for post- menopausal osteoporosis.
It is currently unclear whether Aclasta causes this irregular heart rhythm but you should report it to your doctor if you experience such symptoms after you have received Aclasta.
Very common side effects (affecting 10 or more in every 100 patients):
Fever
Common side effects (affecting less than 10 in every 100 patients):
Fever and chills, headache, feeling sick, pain in your muscles, pain in your bones and/ or joints, tiredness, weakness, dizziness, vomiting, pain in your back, arms or legs.
In patients with Paget’ s disease: symptoms due to low blood calcium, such as muscle spasms, or numbness, or a tingling sensation especially in the area around the mouth.
Uncommon side effects (affecting less than 1 in every 100 patients):
Flu, sleeplessness, tiredness, feeling of pins and needles or tingling sensation, drowsiness, tremor, temporary loss of consciousness, taste disturbance, diarrhoea, indigestion, abdominal pain, dry mouth, inflammation of oesophagus, toothache, joint pain, joint swelling, stiffness, eating disorder, redness, itching and pain in the eyes, chest pain, increased blood pressure, flushing, shortness of breath, rash,
Rare side effects (affecting less than 1 in every 1,000 patients):
Painful red eye.
Skin reactions such as redness, swelling and/ or pain at the infusion site may occur.
Bisphosphonates (the group of substances Aclasta belongs to) may cause swelling, redness, pain and itching of the eyes or eye sensitivity to light.
Persistent pain and/ or non-healing sores of the mouth or jaw have been reported primarily in patients treated with bisphosphonates for other illnesses.
If you experience these symptoms, tell your doctor or dentist.
Allergic reactions have been reported including rare cases of difficulty breathing, hives and angioedema (such as swollen face, tongue or throat).
There have been isolated reports of very serious allergic reactions.
If you notice any of these side effects, tell your doctor.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

31 INFORMATION FOR THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL
The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals only:
The dose of 5 mg of zoledronic acid must be administered over at least 15 minutes.
Aclasta is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 35 ml/ min) due to lack of adequate clinical experience in this population.
Patients should have their serum creatinine level measured before receiving Aclasta.
In patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture, it is recommended to give the Aclasta infusion two or more weeks after hip fracture repair.
Patients must be appropriately hydrated prior to and following administration of Aclasta; this is especially important for patients receiving diuretic therapy.
Caution is indicated when Aclasta is administered in conjunction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function (e. g. aminoglycosides or diuretics that may cause dehydration).
Pre-existing hypocalcaemia must be treated by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before initiating therapy with Aclasta.
Other disturbances of mineral metabolism must also be effectively treated (e. g. diminished parathyroid reserve, intestinal calcium malabsorption).
Physicians should consider clinical monitoring for these patients.
Elevated bone turnover is a characteristic of Paget’ s disease of the bone.
Due to the rapid onset of effect of zoledronic acid on bone turnover, transient hypocalcaemia, sometimes symptomatic, may develop and is usually maximal within the first 10 days after infusion of Aclasta.
Adequate calcium and vitamin D intake are recommended in association with Aclasta administration.
In addition, in patients with Paget's disease, it is strongly advised that adequate supplemental calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium twice daily is ensured for at least 10 days following Aclasta administration.
Patients should be informed about symptoms of hypocalcaemia and receive adequate clinical monitoring during the period of risk.
Measurement of serum calcium before infusion of Aclasta is recommended for patients with Paget´s disease.
In patients with a recent low-trauma hip fracture, a loading dose of 50,000 to 125,000 IU of vitamin D given orally or via the intramuscular route is recommended prior to the first Aclasta infusion.
How to prepare and administer Aclasta
- Aclasta 5 mg solution for infusion is ready for use.
For single use only.
Any unused solution should be discarded.
Only clear solution free from particles and discoloration should be used.
Aclasta must not be mixed or given intravenously with any other medication and must be given through a separate vented infusion line at a constant infusion rate.
The infusion time must not be less than 15 minutes.
Aclasta must not be allowed to come into contact with any calcium-containing solutions.
If refrigerated, allow the refrigerated solution to reach room temperature before administration.
Aseptic techniques must be followed during preparation of the infusion.
The infusion must be conducted according to standard medical practice.
How to store Aclasta
- Keep Aclasta out of the reach and sight of children.
- Do not use Aclasta after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and bottle.
- The unopened bottle does not require any special storage conditions.
- After opening the bottle, the product should be used immediately in order to avoid microbial
contamination.
If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C - 8°C.
Allow the refrigerated solution to reach room temperature before administration.

ACOMPLIA
uth EPAR summary for the public
ra This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package
What is ACOMPLIA?
ACOMPLIA is a medicine containing the active substance rimonabant.
It is available as white, teardrop- shaped tablets. no
What is ACOMPLIA used for?
ACOMPLIA is used together with diet and exercise to treat adult patients: • who are obese (very overweight) with a body mass index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 kg/ m², • who are overweight (with a BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/ m²) and also have other risk factors, ct
such as type 2 diabetes or dyslipidaemia (abnormal levels of fat in their blood).
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription. du
How is ACOMPLIA used?
ACOMPLIA is taken as one tablet once a day, before breakfast.
The medicine should not be used in patients who ro
have severe problems with their liver or their kidneys. lp
How does ACOMPLIA work?
The active substance in ACOMPLIA, rimonabant, is a cannabinoid receptor antagonist.
It acts by blocking a specific type of receptor, the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptors.
The receptors are ina
also found in adipocytes (fat tissue).
How has ACOMPLIA been studied?
The effects of ACOMPLIA were first tested in experimental models before being studied in humans. dic
Four studies of ACOMPLIA in overweight and obese patients were carried out, involving almost 7,000 patients, whose weight at the start of the studies was on average 94 to 104 kg.

(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail@emea. europa. eu http: / /www. emea. europa. eu ©EMEA 2007 Reproduction and/ or distribution of this document is authorised for non commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged studies compared the effect of ACOMPLIA with that of a placebo (a dummy treatment) on weight loss
d over one to two years.
One study also looked at how this loss could be maintained during the second year.
ise Four studies of ACOMPLIA as a help to stop smoking were also carried out in over 7,000 patients, comparing it with placebo, and measuring the effect of the medicine given for 10 weeks (one year in one of the studies) on smoking cessation, and on relapses in the following year.
or What benefit has ACOMPLIA shown during the studies?
After one year, all patients who received ACOMPLIA lost more weight than those who received placebo: they lost on average 4.9 kg more than placebo, except in the study in diabetic patients, where the
uth difference in the weight loss was 3.9 kg.
The medicine also reduced the risk of regaining weight.
The studies in smoking cessation did not show consistent results, and the effect of ACOMPLIA in this area was difficult to estimate.
The company decided to withdraw its application for smoking cessation.
Therefore, ACOMPLIA is not recommended as an aid for smoking cessation
During the studies, the most common side effects with ACOMPLIA (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) were nausea (feeling sick) and infections of the upper respiratory tract.
For the full list of all side effects
ge reported with ACOMPLIA, see the Package Leaflet.
ACOMPLIA should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to rimonabant or any of the other ingredients, or in women who are breast feeding.
It must also not be used in patients with ongoing major depression or who are being treated with antidepressants, since it can increase the risk of lon depression, including thoughts about suicide in a small minority of patients.
Patients who experience symptoms of depression should speak to their doctor and may need to stop treatment.
Caution should be used when taking ACOMPLIA with some medicines, such as ketoconazole or itraconazole (anti-fungal medicines), ritonavir (used in HIV infection), or telithromycin or clarithromycin (antibiotics). no
Why has ACOMPLIA been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ACOMPLIA had shown its effectiveness in weight reduction in obese or overweight patients with associated risk factors.
The Committee decided that ACOMPLIA’ s benefits are greater than its risks when used, in addition to diet and ct
exercise, to treat obese patients and overweight patients with risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dyslipidaemia.
The Committee recommended that ACOMPLIA be given marketing authorisation. du
The company that makes ACOMPLIA will put in place a programme to ensure that the medicine is used in patients who need it for health, rather than for cosmetic reasons, by providing educational packs for ro
patients and doctors, and to monitor how the medicine is used.
The company will use specific databases to monitor ACOMPLIA’ s side effects, especially those linked to the nervous system. lp
Other information about ACOMPLIA:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for ACOMPLIA to sanofi-aventis on 19 June 2006. ina

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications lon As an adjunct to diet and exercise for the treatment of obese patients (BMI ≥ 30 kg/ m2), or overweight patients (BMI > 27 kg/ m2) with associated risk factor(s), such as type 2 diabetes or dyslipidaemia (see section 5.1). no
4.2 Posology and method of administration
In adults, the recommended dosage is one 20 mg tablet daily to be taken in the morning before breakfast. ct
The treatment should be introduced with a mildly reduced calorie diet. du
The safety and efficacy of rimonabant have not been evaluated beyond 2 years.
• Special Populations ro
Elderly:
ACOMPLIA should be used with lp
caution in patients over 75 years of age (see section 4.4).
Patients with hepatic insufficiency: ina
No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment.
ACOMPLIA should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.
ACOMPLIA should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.4 and 5.2). dic
Patients with renal impairment:
No dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2).
Me
Paediatrics:
ACOMPLIA is not recommended for use in children below age 18 due to a lack of data on efficacy and safety.
2 4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients
d Lactation.
Ongoing major depressive illness and/ or ongoing antidepressive treatment (see section 4.4)
ise 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
• Depressive disorders
or Depressive disorders or mood alterations with depressive symptoms have been reported in up to 10%, and suicidal ideation in up to 1%, of patients receiving rimonabant (see section 4.8).
In patients with current suicidal ideations and/ or with a history of suicidal ideation and depressive disorder rimonabant
uth should not be used unless the benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh these risks in an individual patient.
(See section 4.3 and 4.8).
Obesity is a condition that can be associated with depressive disorders.
Depressive disorders can be associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts, self harm and suicide.
ra The prescriber should carefully investigate if the patient has had a depressive disorder in the past in order to evaluate the potential risks with rimonabant treatment.
ge Depressive reactions may occur in patients who have no obvious risk factors, apart from obesity itself.
In postmarketing experience, more than half of the patients who develop such reactions appear to do so within 1 month of starting treatment, approximately 80% appear to do so within 3 months. lon Patients should be actively monitored for signs and symptoms of psychiatric disorders, particularly depression following the start of treatment.
The patient should be monitored and treated appropriately.
Patients, especially those with a history of depressive disorders/ mood alterations, (and relatives or no
other relevant persons) should be alerted about the need to monitor for the emergence of such symptoms and to seek medical advice immediately if these occur.
• Other psychiatric conditions ct
Therapy with rimonabant is not recommended in patients with uncontrolled psychiatric illness.
If psychiatric illness is diagnosed during rimonabant therapy, treatment must be stopped. du
• Seizures Rimonabant has not been studied in patients being treated for epilepsy.
Rimonabant, ro
however, should be used with caution in these patients, see also section 5.3.
• Hepatic impairment lp
Rimonabant is metabolised by the liver, thus caution is advised in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.
The pharmacokinetics and safety of rimonabant have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment; its use in these patients is not recommended. ina
• Renal impairment There are limited data in patients with moderate renal impairment and no data in patients with severe renal impairment.
Rimonabant should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (see section dic
4.2 and 5.2).
• Elderly The efficacy and safety of rimonabant treatment in patients over 75 years of age has not sufficiently Me
Rimonabant should be used with caution in this population (see section 5.2).
d (see section 5.2).
ise • Diabetic patients
Due to the effect of rimonabant on the blood glucose level, when rimonabant is administered in diabetic patients, hypoglyceamia can occur (see section 4.8).
Monitoring of blood glucose level is
or recommended in these patients.
• Drug Interaction
uth Rimonabant should be used with caution in combination with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e. g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, telithromycin, clarithromycin, nefazodone)(see section 4.5).
• Lactose
ra Since ACOMPLIA tablets contain lactose, patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption, should not take this medicine.
ge Patients should be instructed not to increase their dose of ACOMPLIA.
Patients who had a cardiovascular event (myocardial infarction, stroke, etc.) less than 6 months ago lon were excluded in the studies for rimonabant.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Rimonabant is metabolized by both CYP3A and amidohydrolase (predominantly hepatic) pathways in no
Concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors will lead to increased exposure of rimonabant.
Concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers is expected to reduce the exposure of rimonabant. ct
Potential for other medicinal products to affect rimonabant:
Concomitant administration of ketoconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased rimonabant AUC du
by 104% (95% prediction interval:
40% - 197%).
A similar increase in exposure is expected with other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.
Caution is advised during concomitant use of ACOMPLIA and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e. g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, telithromycin, clarithromycin, nefazodone). ro
Although concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers (e. g. rifampicin, phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, St John’ s wort) has not been studied, it is expected that concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers may reduce the plasma concentration of rimonabant and may result in loss of lp
efficacy.
Concomitant administration of orlistat, ethanol or lorazepam had no significant effect on the plasma ina
levels of rimonabant.
Potential for rimonabant to affect other medicinal products:
The in vivo inhibitory effect on CYP2C8 has not been studied.
However, in vitro, rimonabant had a dic
mild inhibitory effect on CYP2C8.
The potential for inhibition of CYP2C8 in vivo appears to be low.
Rimonabant does not inhibit or induce other CYP enzymes or P-glycoprotein (P-gp) in vitro.
Me
4 4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Animal data are inconclusive but
d suggest possible deleterious effects on embryonal/ foetal development (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Use in pregnancy is, therefore, not recommended.
Patients should notify
ise their physician if they become pregnant during treatment with ACOMPLIA.
Rimonabant has been detected in the milk of lactating rats and rimonabant may inhibit the suckling reflex.
It is not known if rimonabant is excreted in human milk.
ACOMPLIA is contraindicated during
or breast-feeding (see section 4.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
uth No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
Cognitive investigations in clinical pharmacology studies demonstrated that rimonabant is devoid of any significant cognitive or sedative effect.
ra 4.8 Undesirable effects
ACOMPLIA 20 mg has been evaluated for safety in approximately 2500 patients enrolled in studies
ge that examined the metabolic and weight loss effects in overweight and obese patients and in approximately 3800 patients in other indications.
In placebo-controlled studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 15.7% for patients receiving rimonabant.
The most common adverse lon reactions resulting in discontinuation were: nausea, mood alteration with depressive symptoms, depressive disorders, anxiety and dizziness.
Depressive disorders were reported in 3.2% of obese patients, or overweight patients with associated risk factor(s) treated with rimonabant 20 mg.
These were usually mild or moderate in severity and no
resulted in recovery in all cases either after corrective treatment or discontinuation of rimonabant and did not exhibit any differentiating characteristics compared to cases reported in the control groups.
The following table (table 1) shows all treatment-emergent adverse reactions from placebo-controlled ct
studies in patients treated for weight loss and related metabolic disorders when these incidences were statistically significantly greater than the corresponding placebo rate (for events ≥ 1%) or considered clinically relevant (for events < 1%). du
Very common (≥ 10%); Common (≥ 1, < 10%); Uncommon (≥ 0.1, < 1%); Rare (≥ 0.01, < 0.1%); Very ro

Laboratory adverse events
or ACOMPLIA has not been shown to alter laboratory test values.
4.9 Overdose
uth Experience with rimonabant in overdosage is limited.
In a single-dose tolerability study, doses up to 300 mg were administered to a limited number of subjects with only minor symptoms reported.
The pharmacokinetic profile demonstrates that a
ra plateau in exposures is reached at 180 mg.
There is no specific antidote for rimonabant; therefore, appropriate supportive measures should be initiated in case of overdose.
Treatment should consist of the general measures employed in the management of overdoses, such as keeping airways
ge unobstructed, monitoring cardiovascular function and general symptomatic and supportive measures.

Clinical study results
Weight Management ro
In total more than 6800 patients were included in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies.
The patients included in the phase 3 trials followed a restrictive diet during the trial prescribed by a dietician and lp
they were advised to increase their physical activity.
Patients had a BMI ≥ 30 kg/ m² or BMI > 27 kg/ m² with hypertension and/ or dyslipidemia at inclusion.
Approximately 80% of the population were women, 87% Caucasian and 9% Black.
Experience in patients over 75 years and ina
Orientals/ Asians was limited.
A mean weight loss of 6.5 kg dic
from baseline to one year was shown for ACOMPLIA 20 mg versus a mean weight loss of 1.6 kg for placebo (Difference -4.9 kg CI95% -5.3; -4.4, p < 0.001).

ra Most of the observed weight reduction was obtained within the first nine months of treatment.
ACOMPLIA 20 mg was effective in maintaining weight loss up to two years.
Weight loss at two years
ge was 5.1 kg for patients who received ACOMPLIA 20 mg and 1.2 kg for placebo (Difference -3.8 kg; CI95% -4.4, -3.3; p < 0.001).
Rimonabant 20 mg reduced the risk of weight regain.
Patients who received ACOMPLIA 20 mg for one year were re-randomized to ACOMPLIA 20 mg or placebo.
At two years, patients continuing on rimonabant had a mean total weight loss of 7.5 kg over 2 years whereas patients re-randomized to placebo group during the second year had a mean total weight loss of 3.1 kg over 2 years.
At two years, the difference in total weight loss between ACOMPLIA and placebo was -4.2 kg (CI95% -5.0; - no
Treatment with rimonabant was associated with significant reductions in waist circumference, a known marker of intra-abdominal fat. ct
The effects on body weight appeared to be consistent among men and women.
In the limited number of Black patients weight loss was less pronounced (mean difference to placebo -2.9 kg).
No du
conclusions can be drawn with regard to effects in patients over 75 years or in Asian/ Oriental patients due to the low number of patients. ro
For lp
HDL-C an average increase of 16.4% was seen under rimonabant 20 mg (baseline HDL-C 1.24 mmol/ l) compared to an increase of 8.9% for placebo (baseline HDL-C 1.21 mmol/ l).
For the ina
triglycerides an average decrease of 6.9% was seen under rimonabant 20 mg (baseline TG 1.62 mmol/ l) compared to an increase of 5.8% for placebo (baseline TG 1.65 mmol/ l).
The difference was statistically significant (Difference -13.3% CI95% -16.5; -10.2% p < 0.001).
It is estimated that approximately half of the observed improvement in HDL-C and triglycerides in patients who received dic
rimonabant 20 mg was beyond that expected from weight loss alone.
Generally ACOMPLIA 20 mg had no significant effect on Total-C or LDL-C levels.
In the trial in type 2 diabetic patients (RIO-Diabetes) who were overweight or obese treated with Me
The absolute change in HbA1c at one year was -0.6 for rimonabant 20 mg (baseline 7.3%) and +0.1 on placebo (baseline 7.2%).
Differences were statistically significant (Difference -0.7%, CI95% -0.80; -0.5, p < 0.001).
8 At one year a mean weight loss of 5.3 kg was shown for ACOMPLIA 20 mg versus a loss on placebo of 1.4 kg (Difference – 3.9 kg CI95% -4.6; -3.3 p < 0.001).
The percentage of patients who lost 5% and 10% of their baseline body weight after 1 year of treatment are given in the table 2.
d In a second trial in treatment naïve type 2 diabetic obese patients (Serenade), the absolute change in HbA1c (with a baseline of 7.9% for both groups) at six months was -0.8 for rimonabant 20 mg and
ise -0.3 under placebo (Difference -0.51 CI95% -0.78, -0.24 p < 0.001).
The percentage of patients reaching HbA1c < 7% was 51% in the rimonabant group and 35% in the placebo group.
The difference in mean body weight change between the 20 mg and placebo groups was 3.8 kg (CI95% -5.0, -2.6 p < 0.001).
Changes in HDL-C and TG in this population were similar to that of the non-diabetic population.
It is
or estimated that approximately half of the mean improvement in HbA1c in patients receiving rimonabant 20 mg was beyond that expected from weight loss alone.
uth 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Rimonabant pharmacokinetics are fairly dose proportional up to about 20 mg.
AUC increased less than in proportion to dose above 20 mg.
ra Absorption:
Rimonabant displays high in vitro permeability and is not a substrate of P-glycoprotein.
The absolute bioavailability of rimonabant has not been determined.
Following multiple once-daily doses of 20 mg
ge to healthy subjects in the fasted state, maximum plasma concentrations of rimonabant are achieved in approximately 2 hours with steady state plasma levels achieved within 13 days (Cmax = 196 ± 28.1 ng/ ml; Ctrough = 91.6 ± 14.1 ng/ ml; AUC0-24 = 2960 ± 268 ng. h/ ml).
Steady state rimonabant lon exposures are 3.3-fold higher than those observed after the first dose.
Population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated less fluctuation in peak to trough plasma concentration but no differences in steady state AUC as weight increases.
As weight increases from 65 to 200 kg, Cmax is expected to decrease 24% and Ctrough is expected to increase by 5%.
Population no
pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that rimonabant pharmacokinetics are similar between healthy non-smoking subjects and patients who smoke.
Administration of rimonabant to healthy subjects in the fasted state or with a high fat meal demonstrated that Cmax and AUC were increased 67% and 48% respectively, under fed conditions.
In clinical studies, ACOMPLIA 20 mg was taken in the morning usually before breakfast. du
Distribution:
The in vitro human plasma protein binding of rimonabant is high (> 99.9%) and non-saturable over a ro
wide concentration range.
The apparent peripheral volume of distribution of rimonabant appears to be related to body weight, with obese patients having a higher volume of distribution than normal-weight subjects. lp
Biotransformation:
Rimonabant is metabolized by both CYP3A and amidohydrolase (predominantly hepatic) pathways in ina
Circulating metabolites do not contribute to its pharmacologic activity.
Elimination:
Only dic
an approximate 3% of the dose of rimonabant is eliminated in the urine, while approximately 86% of the dose is excreted in the faeces as unchanged drug and metabolites.
Me
9 Special Populations Race:
In single- and repeat-dose studies, the Cmax and AUC of rimonabant were similar in healthy Japanese
d and Caucasian subjects, whereas elimination half-life was shorter in Japanese subjects (3-4 days) compared to Caucasian subjects (about 9 days).
The difference in half-life was due to differences in
ise peripheral volume of distribution as a consequence of lower weight in Japanese subjects.
Black patients may have up to a 31% lower Cmax and a 43% lower AUC than patients of other races.
Gender:
or The pharmacokinetics of rimonabant are similar in female and male patients.
Elderly:
uth Elderly patients have slightly higher exposure than young patients.
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis (age range 18 - 81 years) a 75 year old patient is estimated to have a 21% higher Cmax and a 27% higher AUC than a 40 year old patient.
ra Patients with hepatic insufficiency:
Mild hepatic impairment does not alter rimonabant exposure.
Data are insufficient to draw conclusions regarding pharmacokinetics in moderate hepatic impairment.
Patients with severe hepatic impairment were not evaluated.
ge Patients with renal impairment:
The effect of renal function on the pharmacokinetics of rimonabant has not been studied specifically. lon Based on data from population pharmacokinetic studies, mild renal impairment do not seem to affect the pharmacokinetics of rimonabant.
Limited data suggest an increased exposure in patients with moderate renal impairment (40% increase in AUC).
There are no data in severe renal impairment.
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows:
Convulsions were observed sporadically in studies in rodents and macaques.
No convulsions were ct
observed in dogs during a 3 month study.
In some, but not all cases, initiation of convulsions appeared to be associated with procedural stress such as handling of the animals.
A proconvulsant activity of rimonabant was found in one of two safety pharmacology studies.
No adverse effect of rimonabant du
treatment was observed on EEG patterns in rats.
Increased incidence and/ or severity of clinical signs suggestive of increased tactile hyperesthesia were ro
observed in rodent studies.
A direct effect of rimonabant cannot be ruled out.
in the rat.
In standard fertility studies in female rats (dosing for 2 weeks prior to mating) there was abnormal ina
oestrous cyclicity and a decrease in corpora lutea and fertility index at doses of rimonabant that induced maternal toxicity (30 and 60 mg/ kg/ day).
Following dosing for a longer treatment duration prior to mating (9 weeks) that permitted recovery from the initial effects of rimonabant, no adverse effects were seen on fertility or oestrous cyclicity.
Regarding reproductive parameters, at 30 mg/ kg no dic
differences were observed between treated animals and controls, at 60 mg/ kg effects were still observed (decreased number of corpora lutea, implantations, total and viable fetuses).
Sporadic malformations (anencephaly, micro-ophthalmia, widened brain ventricles and omphalocele) Me
were observed in the rabbit embryofetal toxicity studies at doses resulting in exposures comparable with the clinical exposures.
Although maternal toxicity was observed at these doses, a relation to treatment cannot be excluded.
No treatment-related malformations were seen in the rat.
10 Effects of rimonabant on pre- and post-natal development were assessed in the rat at doses up to 10 mg/ kg/ day.
There was a treatment related increase in pup mortality in the pre-weaning period.
The increased pup mortality might be attributable to a failure of the dam to nurse or ingestion of
d rimonabant in milk and/ or inhibition of the suckling reflex that is reported in the literature to be initiated in neonatal mice by endocannabinoid signalling via CB1 receptors.
There are reports in the
The potential relevance of this to administration of a CB1 antagonist is unknown.
In the pre- and post-natal development study in rats, exposure to rimonabant in utero and via lactation produced no alterations on learning or memory, but equivocal effects on motor
or activity and auditory startle response were observed in the pups as a result of rimonabant exposure.

EUROPEAN PUBLIC ASSESSMENT REPORT (EPAR)
ACTOS
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package Leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.
If you want more information on the basis of the CHMP recommendations, read the Scientific Discussion (also part of the EPAR).
What is Actos?
Actos is a medicine containing the active substance pioglitazone.
The white, round tablets contain 15, 30 or 45 mg of pioglitazone.
What is Actos used for?
Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used on its own (monotherapy) in patients (particularly those who are overweight) who cannot use metformin (an antidiabetic medicine). • It can be used together with one other antidiabetic medicine (dual therapy).
It can be added to metformin in patients (particularly those who are overweight) who are not satisfactorily controlled on metformin used on its own and at the maximum tolerated dose.
Alternatively, it can be added to a sulphonylurea (another antidiabetic medicine) in patients for whom metformin is not suitable and who are not satisfactorily controlled with the sulphonylurea used on its own at the maximum tolerated dose. • It can be used together with two other antidiabetic medicines, metformin and a sulphonylurea, as triple therapy in patients (particularly those who are overweight) who are not satisfactorily controlled with these two medicines. • It can be used together with insulin in patients who are not satisfactorily controlled with insulin alone and cannot take metformin.
How is Actos used?
Actos is taken once daily with or without food.
The dose is adjusted to give the best control.
The recommended starting dose is 15 mg or 30 mg once daily.
This dose may need to be increased after one or two weeks to up to 45 mg once daily.
In combination with metformin, the current metformin dose can be continued when starting Actos treatment.
In combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin, the current sulphonylurea or insulin dose can be continued when starting Actos treatment unless the patient has hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose), when the dose of the sulphonylurea or insulin should be decreased.
How does Actos work?
Pioglitazone, the active ingredient in Actos, makes the cells more sensitive to

How has Actos been studied?
Actos has been studied in clinical pharmacology studies and in clinical trials.
Almost 7,000 patients received Actos in all trials combined.
The studies compared Actos to placebo (a dummy treatment), or to other antidiabetic medicines (metformin, gliclazide).
Some studies also looked at combining Actos with other antidiabetic medicines (sulphonylureas, insulin, metformin).
Further studies also looked at long-term use of Actos.
In triple therapy, the effectiveness of Actos was studied in more than 1,400 patients who were receiving a combination of metformin and a sulphonylurea, to which was added either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.
The studies measured the level in the blood of a substance (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c), which gives an indication of how well the blood glucose is controlled.
What benefit has Actos shown during the studies?
Actos led to a decrease in the level of HbA1c, indicating that blood glucose levels had been reduced at doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.
Doses below 15 mg were not effective, and doses above 45 mg (once daily) did not show additional benefit.
Actos on its own was shown to be as effective as metformin and gliclazide.
In combination, Actos showed that it improves the control obtained in type 2 diabetes when added to existing treatment.
At the end of the triple therapy study, the effect of adding Actos to the existing treatment with metformin and a sulphonylurea was a 0.94% reduction in HbA1c levels, while adding placebo led to a 0.35% reduction.
In a small study examining the combination of Actos and insulin in 289 patients, patients adding Actos to insulin had a 0.69% reduction in HbA1c levels after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in those adding placebo.
What is the risk associated with Actos?
The most common side effects with Actos are visual disturbance, upper respiratory tract infection (colds), weight increase, and hypoaesthesia (decreased sensitivity to a stimulus).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Actos, see the Package Leaflet.
Actos should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other ingredients, or in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high levels of ketones [acids] in the blood).
Why has Actos been approved?
The committee recommended that Actos be given marketing authorisation.
In monotherapy (used on its own), the committee decided that Actos should be an alternative to the standard treatment, metformin, to be used when patients cannot take metformin.
Other information about Actos:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union, for Actos to Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited on 13 October 2000.
The marketing authorisation was renewed on 13 October 2005.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Pioglitazone is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus:
- in patients (particularly overweight patients) inadequately controlled by diet and exercise
for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance
as dual oral therapy in combination with
- metformin, in patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient glycaemic
control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with metformin
- a sulphonylurea, only in patients who show intolerance to metformin or for whom
metformin is contraindicated, with insufficient glycaemic control despite maximal tolerated dose of monotherapy with a sulphonylurea.
as triple oral therapy in combination with
- metformin and a sulphonylurea, in patients (particularly overweight patients) with insufficient
glycaemic control despite dual oral therapy.
Pioglitazone is also indicated for combination with insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with insufficient glycaemic control on insulin for whom metformin is inappropriate because of contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Pioglitazone tablets are taken orally once daily with or without food.
Pioglitazone may be initiated at 15mg or 30mg once daily.
The dose may be increased in increments up to 45mg once daily.
2 In combination with insulin, the current insulin dose can be continued upon initiation of pioglitazone therapy.
If patients report hypoglycaemia, the dose of insulin should be decreased.
Elderly:
No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment:
No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function (creatinine clearance > 4 ml/ min) (see section 5.2).
No information is available from dialysed patients therefore pioglitazone should not be used in such patients.
Patients with hepatic impairment:
Pioglitazone should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.4).
Children and adolescents:
There are no data available on the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, and therefore its use is not recommended in this age group.
4.3 Contraindications
Pioglitazone is contraindicated in patients with:
- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients
- cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure (NYHA stages I to IV)
- hepatic impairment
- diabetic ketoacidosis.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Fluid retention and cardiac failure:
Pioglitazone can cause fluid retention, which may exacerbate or precipitate heart failure.
When treating patients who have at least one risk factor for development of congestive heart failure (e. g. prior myocardial infarction or symptomatic coronary artery disease), physicians should start with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.
Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema particularly those with reduced cardiac reserve.
There have been cases of cardiac failure reported from the market when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulinor in patients with a history of cardiac failure; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.
Since insulin and pioglitazone are associated with fluid retention, concomitant administration may increase the risk of oedema.
Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac status occurs.
A cardiovascular outcome study of pioglitazone has been performed in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing major macrovascular disease.
Pioglitazone or placebo was added to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy for up to 3.5 years.
This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure, however this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study.
Caution should be exercised in patients over 75 years because of the limited experience in this patient group.
3 Monitoring of liver function:
There have been rare reports of hepatocellular dysfunction during post-marketing experience (see section 4.8).
It is recommended, therefore, that patients treated with pioglitazone undergo periodic monitoring of liver enzymes.
Liver enzymes should be checked prior to the initiation of therapy with pioglitazone in all patients.
Therapy with pioglitazone should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver enzyme levels (ALT > 2.5 X upper limit of normal) or with any other evidence of liver disease.
Following initiation of therapy with pioglitazone, it is recommended that liver enzymes be monitored periodically based on clinical judgement.
If ALT levels are increased to 3 X upper limit of normal during pioglitazone therapy, liver enzyme levels should be reassessed as soon as possible.
If ALT levels remain > 3 X the upper limit of normal, therapy should be discontinued.
If any patient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dysfunction, which may include unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorexia and/ or dark urine, liver enzymes should be checked.
The decision whether to continue the patient on therapy with pioglitazone should be guided by clinical judgement pending laboratory evaluations.
If jaundice is observed, drug therapy should be discontinued.
Weight gain:
In clinical trials with pioglitazone there was evidence of dose related weight gain, which may be due to fat accumulation and in some cases associated with fluid retention.
In some cases weight increase may be a symptom of cardiac failure, therefore weight should be closely monitored.
Part of the treatment of diabetes is dietary control.
Patients should be advised to adhere strictly to a calorie-controlled diet.
Haematology:
There was a small reduction in mean haemoglobin (4% relative reduction) and haematocrit (4.1% relative reduction) during therapy with pioglitazone, consistent with haemodilution.
Similar changes were seen in metformin (haemoglobin 3 - 4% and haematocrit 3.6 – 4.1% relative reductions) and to a lesser extent sulphonylurea and insulin (haemoglobin 1 – 2% and haematocrit 1 – 3.2% relative reductions) treated patients in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone.
Hypoglycaemia
As a consequence of increased insulin sensitivity, patients receiving pioglitazone in dual or triple oral therapy with a sulphonylurea or in dual therapy with insulin may be at risk for dose-related hypoglycaemia, and a reduction in the dose of the sulphonylurea or insulin may be necessary.
Eye disorders:
Post-marketing reports of new-onset or worsening diabetic macular oedema with decreased visual acuity have been reported with thiazolidinediones, including pioglitazone.
Many of these patients reported concurrent peripheral oedema.
It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association between pioglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be alert to the possibility of macular oedema if patients report disturbances in visual acuity; an appropriate ophthalmological referral should be considered.
Others:
An increased incidence in bone fractures in women was seen in a pooled analysis of adverse event reports of bone fracture from randomised, controlled, double blind clinical trials in over 8100 pioglitazone and 7400 comparator treated patients, on treatment for up to 3.5 years.
Fractures were observed in 2.6% of women taking pioglitazone compared to 1.7% of women treated with a comparator.
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.3%) versus comparator (1.5%).
4 The fracture incidence calculated was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparator.
The observed excess risk of fractures for women in this dataset on pioglitazone is therefore 0.8 fractures per 100 patient years of use.
In the 3.5 year cardiovascular risk PROactive study, 44/ 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/ 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) of female patients treated with comparator.
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus comparator (2.1%).
The risk of fractures should be considered in the long term care of women treated with pioglitazone.
As a consequence of enhancing insulin action, pioglitazone treatment in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome may result in resumption of ovulation.
These patients may be at risk of pregnancy.
Patients should be aware of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to become pregnant or if pregnancy occurs, the treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.6).
Pioglitazone should be used with caution during concomitant administration of cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitors (e. g. gemfibrozil) or inducers (e. g. rifampicin).
Glycaemic control should be monitored closely.
Pioglitazone dose adjustment within the recommended posology or changes in diabetic treatment should be considered (see section 4.5).
Actos tablets contain lactose monohydrate and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.
Co-administration of pioglitazone with sulphonylureas does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of the sulphonylurea.
Studies in man suggest no induction of the main inducible cytochrome P450, 1A, 2C8/ 9 and 3A4.
In vitro studies have shown no inhibition of any subtype of cytochrome P450.
Interactions with substances metabolised by these enzymes, e. g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporin, calcium channel blockers, and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.
Co-administration of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported to result in a 3-fold increase in AUC of pioglitazone.
Since there is a potential for an increase in dose-related adverse events, a decrease in the dose of pioglitazone may be needed when gemfibrozil is concomitantly administered.
Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered (see section 4.4).
Co- administration of pioglitazone with rifampicin (an inducer of cytochrome P450 2C8) is reported to result in a 54% decrease in AUC of pioglitazone.
The pioglitazone dose may need to be increased when rifampicin is concomitantly administered.
Close monitoring of glycaemic control should be considered (see section 4.4).
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Use in pregnancy:
Foetal growth restriction was apparent in animal studies with pioglitazone.
This was attributable to the action of pioglitazone in diminishing the maternal hyperinsulinaemia and increased insulin resistance that occurs during pregnancy thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for foetal growth.
The relevance of such a mechanism in humans is unclear and pioglitazone should not be used in pregnancy.
5 Use in breast-feeding:
Pioglitazone has been shown to be present in the milk of lactating rats.
It is not known whether pioglitazone is secreted in human milk.
Therefore, pioglitazone should not be administered to breast-feeding women.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No effects on ability to drive and use machines have been observed.
4.8 Undesirable effects

POST-MARKETING DATA
Eye disorders Macular oedema: not known
8 Oedema was reported in 6 – 9% of patients treated with pioglitazone over one year in controlled clinical trials.
The oedema rates for comparator groups (sulphonylurea, metformin) were 2 – 5%.
The reports of oedema were generally mild to moderate and usually did not require discontinuation of treatment.
In active comparator controlled trials mean weight increase with pioglitazone given as monotherapy was 2 – 3 kg over one year.
This is similar to that seen in a sulphonylurea active comparator group.
In combination trials pioglitazone added to metformin resulted in mean weight increase over one year of 1.5 kg and added to a sulphonylurea of 2.8 kg.
In comparator groups addition of sulphonylurea to metformin resulted in a mean weight gain of 1.3 kg and addition of metformin to a sulphonylurea a mean weight loss of 1.0 kg.
Visual disturbance has been reported mainly early in treatment and is related to changes in blood glucose due to temporary alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens as seen with other hypoglycaemic agents.
In clinical trials with pioglitazone the incidence of elevations of ALT greater than three times the upper limit of normal was equal to placebo but less than that seen in metformin or sulphonylurea comparator groups.
Mean levels of liver enzymes decreased with treatment with pioglitazone.
Rare cases of elevated liver enzymes and hepatocellular dysfunction have occurred in post-marketing experience.
Although in very rare cases fatal outcome has been reported, causal relationship has not been established.
In controlled clinical trials the incidence of reports of heart failure with pioglitazone treatment was the same as in placebo, metformin and sulphonylurea treatment groups, but was increased when used in combination therapy with insulin.
In an outcome study of patients with pre-existing major macrovascular disease, the incidence of serious heart failure was 1.6% higher with pioglitazone than with placebo, when added to therapy that included insulin.
However, this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study.
Heart failure has been reported rarely with marketing use of pioglitazone, but more frequently when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with a history of cardiac failure.
A pooled analysis was conducted of adverse event reports of bone fractures from randomised, comparator controlled, double blind clinical trials in over 8100 patients in the pioglitazone-treated groups and 7400 in the comparator-treated groups of up to 3.5 years duration.
A higher rate of fractures was observed in women taking pioglitazone (2.6%) versus comparator (1.7%).
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.3%) versus comparator (1.5%).
In the 3.5 year PROactive study, 44/ 870 (5.1%) of pioglitazone-treated female patients experienced fractures compared to 23/ 905 (2.5%) of female patients treated with comparator.
No increase in fracture rates was observed in men treated with pioglitazone (1.7%) versus comparator (2.1%).
4.9 Overdose
Patients have taken pioglitazone at higher than the recommended highest dose of 45 mg daily.
The maximum reported dose of 120 mg/ day for four days, then 180 mg/ day for seven days was not associated with any symptoms.
Hypoglycaemia may occur in combination with sulphonylureas or insulin.
Symptomatic and general supportive measures should be taken in case of overdose.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: oral blood glucose lowering drugs; Thiazolidinediones; ATC code:
A10 BG 03.
9 Pioglitazone effects may be mediated by a reduction of insulin resistance.
Pioglitazone appears to act via activation of specific nuclear receptors (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma) leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in animals.
Treatment with pioglitazone has been shown to reduce hepatic glucose output and to increase peripheral glucose disposal in the case of insulin resistance.
Fasting and postprandial glycaemic control is improved in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
The improved glycaemic control is associated with a reduction in both fasting and postprandial plasma insulin concentrations.
A clinical trial of pioglitazone vs. gliclazide as monotherapy was extended to two years in order to assess time to treatment failure (defined as appearance of HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first six months of therapy).
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed shorter time to treatment failure in patients treated with gliclazide, compared with pioglitazone.
At two years, glycaemic control (defined as HbA1c < 8.0%) was sustained in 69% of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared with 50% of patients on gliclazide.
In a two-year study of combination therapy comparing pioglitazone with gliclazide when added to metformin, glycaemic control measured as mean change from baseline in HbA1c was similar between treatment groups after one year.
The rate of deterioration of HbA1c during the second year was less with pioglitazone than with gliclazide.
In a placebo controlled trial, patients with inadequate glycaemic control despite a three month insulin optimisation period were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo for 12 months.
Patients receiving pioglitazone had a mean reduction in HbA1c of 0.45% compared with those continuing on insulin alone, and a reduction of insulin dose in the pioglitazone treated group.
HOMA analysis shows that pioglitazone improves beta cell function as well as increasing insulin sensitivity.
Two-year clinical studies have shown maintenance of this effect.
In one year clinical trials, pioglitazone consistently gave a statistically significant reduction in the albumin/ creatinine ratio compared to baseline.
The effect of pioglitazone (45 mg monotherapy vs. placebo) was studied in a small 18-week trial in type 2 diabetics.
Pioglitazone was associated with significant weight gain.
Visceral fat was significantly decreased, while there was an increase in extra-abdominal fat mass.
Similar changes in body fat distribution on pioglitazone have been accompanied by an improvement in insulin sensitivity.
In most clinical trials, reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids, and increased HDL-cholesterol levels were observed as compared to placebo, with small, but not clinically significant increases in LDL-cholesterol levels.
In clinical trials of up to two years duration, pioglitazone reduced total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids, and increased HDL cholesterol levels, compared with placebo, metformin or gliclazide.
Pioglitazone did not cause statistically significant increases in LDL cholesterol levels compared with placebo, whilst reductions were observed with metformin and gliclazide.
In a 20-week study, as well as reducing fasting triglycerides, pioglitazone reduced post prandial hypertriglyceridaemia through an effect on both absorbed and hepatically synthesised triglycerides.
These effects were independent of pioglitazone’ s effects on glycaemia and were statistically significant different to glibenclamide.
In PROactive, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing major macrovascular disease were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo in addition to existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular therapy, for up to 3.5 years.
The study population had an average age of 62 years; the average duration of diabetes was 9.5 years.
Approximately one third of patients were receiving insulin in combination with metformin and/ or a sulphonylurea.
To be eligible patients had to have had one or more of the following: myocardial infarction, stroke, percutaneous cardiac intervention or coronary artery bypass graft, acute coronary syndrome, coronary artery disease, or peripheral arterial obstructive disease.
Almost half of the patients had a previous myocardial infarction and approximately 20% had had a stroke.
Approximately half of the study population had at least two of the cardiovascular history entry criteria.
Almost all subjects (95%) were receiving cardiovascular medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, calcium channel blockers, nitrates, diuretics, aspirin, statins, fibrates).
10 Although the study failed regarding its primary endpoint, which was a composite of all-cause mortality, non- fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, major leg amputation, coronary revascularisation and leg revascularisation, the results suggest that there are no long-term cardiovascular concerns regarding use of pioglitazone.
However, the incidences of oedema, weight gain and heart failure were increased.
No increase in mortality from heart failure was observed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption:
Following oral administration, pioglitazone is rapidly absorbed, and peak plasma concentrations of unchanged pioglitazone are usually achieved 2 hours after administration.
Proportional increases of the plasma concentration were observed for doses from 2 – 60 mg.
Steady state is achieved after 4– 7 days of dosing.
Repeated dosing does not result in accumulation of the compound or metabolites.
Absorption is not influenced by food intake.
Absolute bioavailability is greater than 80%.
Distribution:
The estimated volume of distribution in humans is 0.25 l/ kg.
Pioglitazone and all active metabolites are extensively bound to plasma protein (> 99%).
Metabolism:
Pioglitazone undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism by hydroxylation of aliphatic methylene groups.
This is predominantly via cytochrome P450 2C8 although other isoforms may be involved to a lesser degree.
