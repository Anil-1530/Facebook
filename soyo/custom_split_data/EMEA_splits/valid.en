Further information
1.
WHAT ABSEAMED IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Abseamed contains a hormone called epoetin alfa, which stimulates the production of red blood cells.
Epoetin alfa is produced by a specialised genetic technology and works in exactly the same way as the natural hormone erythropoietin.
Abseamed is used: for treating symptomatic anaemia associated with kidney disease (given by injection into a vein) in children and adults on dialysis in adults on peritoneal dialysis for treating severe symptomatic anaemia caused by kidney disease in adults not yet undergoing dialysis (given by injection into a vein) for treating anaemia and reducing the need for a blood transfusion in adults receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the doctor in moderately anaemic patients who are going to have surgery and prior to it, donate blood so that their own blood can be given to them during or after surgery (autologous predonation) as an alternative to a blood transfusion in adult patients about to undergo major orthopaedic (bone) surgery where there is a potentially high risk from blood transfusion complications
188 2.
BEFORE YOU USE ABSEAMED
Do not use Abseamed:
- if you are allergic (hypersensitive) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients of Abseamed
- if you have developed Pure Red Cell Aplasia (reduced or stopped production of red blood cells)
following treatment with any erythropoietin
- if you have high blood pressure which is not properly controlled
- if you are donating your own blood before surgery, and:
• you had a heart attack or stroke in the month before your treatment • you have unstable angina pectoris (new or increasing chest pain) • you are at risk of blood clots in the veins (deep venous thrombosis) – for example, if you have had clots before
- if you cannot receive adequate treatment for the prevention of blood clots (antithrombotic
prophylaxis)
- if you are due to have major orthopaedic surgery and:
you have severe disorders of blood circulation of the heart (coronary heart disease), arteries of the legs or arms (peripheral arterial occlusive disease), neck vessels (vascular disease of the carotids) or the brain (cerebrovascular disease) you had a recent heart attack or stroke
If any of these applies to you, or might apply, tell your doctor at once.
Take special care with Abseamed:
General
In all patients treated with Abseamed blood pressure should be closely monitored and treated, if necessary.
Abseamed should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inadequately treated or poorly controllable hypertension.
It may be necessary to initiate or increase treatment against high blood pressure.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, Abseamed treatment should be discontinued.
Take special care with Abseamed if you have epilepsy or chronic liver disease.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent increase in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with Abseamed, which gradually regresses during the course of continued therapy.
Your doctor may do regular blood tests to check your blood platelet count during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia, e. g. iron deficiency, damage of red blood cells (haemolysis), blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be taken into account and treated prior to initiating therapy with Abseamed.
In order to ensure optimum response to Abseamed adequate iron stores should be ensured.
Your doctor may do blood tests to decide, if you need iron supplements.
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA)
Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported in patients after months to years of subcutaneous (injection under the skin) erythropoietin treatment.
PRCA means the inability to produce enough red blood cells in the bone marrow.
PRCA can result in sudden and severe anaemia, the symptoms of which are unusual tiredness, feeling dizzy or breathlessness.
If you experience these symptoms you should talk to your doctor at once.
Your doctor can decide whether Abseamed is not working properly for you.
If you develop PRCA your Abseamed therapy will be discontinued and your doctor will decide how best to treat your anaemia.
189 Kidney patients
There is not much experience with subcutaneous use (injection into the skin) of Abseamed in kidney patients.
Therefore, if you are being treated for anaemia associated with kidney disease, Abseamed has to be given by injection into a vein (intravenously).
Your doctor will check your levels of the red blood pigment (haemoglobin) regularly
- to ensure that your haemoglobin does not exceed a certain level as high haemoglobin could put
you at risk of having a problem of the heart or the blood vessels and could increase risk of death
- to minimise the risk of an increase in blood pressure.
Increased levels of potassium (hyperkalaemia) have been observed in isolated cases.
The correction of your anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and thus increased potassium and protein intake.
Therefore dialysis procedures may have to be adjusted to maintain urea, creatinine and potassium in the desired range.
Serum electrolytes should be monitored.
If an elevated or increasing serum potassium level is detected, your doctor may consider to discontinue the treatment with Abseamed until the potassium level has returned to the normal range.
An increase in dose of a particular blood-thinning medicine (heparin) during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with Abseamed.
Inadequate thinning of the blood by heparin (heparinisation) may lead to occlusion of the dialysis system.
If you have chronic kidney failure and clinically evident coronary heart disease or signs of congestion due to inadequate heart output, your doctor will make sure that your haemoglobin levels do not exceed a certain level.
Based on information available to date, treatment of anaemia with Abseamed in adult patients with chronic kidney failure (renal insufficiency) who do not yet require dialysis, does not accelerate the rate of progression of renal insufficiency.
Cancer patients
The 2-3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appearance of desired effects should be taken into account when assessing the efficacy of Abseamed.
Your doctor will check your levels of the red blood pigment (haemoglobin) regularly and adjust your dose of Abseamed accordingly to minimise the risk of blood clotting (thrombotic events).
Cancer patients receiving treatment with erythropoietin have an increased risk of blood clots/ blood clotting disorders (thrombotic vascular events).
This risk should be carefully weighted against the benefit to be derived from treatment with epoetin alfa, particularly if you have an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, e. g. if you are obese or have a history of thrombotic vascular events (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism).
If you are a cancer patient you should be aware that Abseamed may act as a blood cell growth factor and in some circumstances may have a negative impact on your cancer.
Depending on your individual situation a blood transfusion may be preferable.
Please discuss this with your doctor.
Patients donating their own blood before surgery
Your doctor will consider warnings and precautions associated with autologous blood predonation, especially volume replacement.
Patients scheduled for orthopaedic surgery
If you are due to have major orthopaedic surgery, the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of Abseamed treatment.
Blood clots (thrombotic events) can be a
Your doctor will weight this risk carefully against the benefits to be derived from treatment with epoetin alfa.
You should receive adequate measures in order to prevent blood clots (thrombotic prophylaxis), particularly if you have cardiovascular disorders.
If your levels of the red blood pigment (haemoglobin) are too high you should not receive Abseamed, since you have an increased risk of blood clotting after the surgery.
Tumour growth potential
If you are a cancer patient be aware that erythropoietins may act as growth factor.
Please discuss this with your doctor.
Taking other medicines
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
If you are taking cyclosporin (medicine to suppress your immune system) during therapy with Abseamed, your doctor may order special blood tests to measure cyclosporin levels.
Laboratory tests did not show an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF (G-CSF and GM-CSF are medicines to stimulate the immune-system e. g. when receiving a chemotherapy for cancer or in case of HIV).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
There is not much experience with Abseamed in pregnant women or women who are breast-feeding.
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Driving and using machines
No effects on ability to drive or use machines have been observed.

HOW TO USE ABSEAMED
General
Your doctor will conduct investigations, for example blood tests, to decide if it is necessary for you to have Abseamed.
He/ she will work out the correct dose of Abseamed for you to use and how long the treatment should continue.
The dose you receive is based on your body weight in kilograms.
The Abseamed pre-filled syringe is ready for use.
Only solutions which are clear, colourless and free of visible particles may be injected.
Abseamed is a sterile but unpreserved product and is for single use only.

When your condition has been brought under control, you will receive regular doses of Abseamed between 25 and 50 IU/ kg twice a week in two equal injections.
Adults with kidney disease not yet receiving dialysis
The usual starting dose is 50 International Units (IU) per kilogram bodyweight.
This is given three times a week by injection into a vein.
The starting dose may be adjusted by your doctor approximately every 4 weeks until your condition is controlled.
Your doctor may order regular blood tests to see that control is being achieved and to ensure that your haemoglobin does not exceed a certain level.
After your condition has been brought under control, you will receive regular doses of Abseamed between 17 and 33 IU/ kg, three times a week.
The dosage should not normally exceed 200 IU per kilogram, three times a week.
Your doctor will order regular blood tests to ensure that your medicine is continuing to work properly.
Children receiving haemodialysis
The usual starting dose is 50 International Units (IU) per kilogram bodyweight.
This is given three times a week, injected into a vein.
Depending on how the anaemia responds, the dose may be adjusted approximately every 4 weeks until the condition is controlled.
The doctor will order regular blood tests to see that this is being achieved and to ensure that the haemoglobin value does not exceed a certain level.
Cancer patients
The usual starting dose is 150 International Units (IU) per kilogram bodyweight.
This is given 3 times a week by injection under the skin (subcutaneously).
Alternatively, Abseamed can be administered as an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg once a week by injection under the skin.

Use in adult patients in an autologous predonation programme
The usual starting dose is 600 International Units (IU) per kilogram bodyweight.
This is given 2 times a week by injection into a vein.
You will receive Abseamed during the 3 weeks before your surgery.
You will also take iron supplements before and during Abseamed treatment to increase the effectiveness of Abseamed.
192 Adult patients scheduled for orthopaedic surgery
The recommended dose of 600 International Units (IU) per kilogram bodyweight is given weekly for three weeks before surgery and on the day of surgery.
This is given by injection under the skin (subcutaneously).
In cases where there is a need to shorten the time for treatment before the operation is carried out, a dose of 300 IU/ kg is given on each of the next ten days before surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately afterwards.
If blood tests in the period before the operation show your haemoglobin level to be too high, the treatment will be stopped.
It is important that levels of iron in your blood are normal throughout Abseamed treatment.
Where appropriate you will receive oral doses of iron, ideally starting before the Abseamed treatment begins.
Instructions for injecting Abseamed under the skin
Please note:
If you are a kidney patient Abseamed has to be given by injection into a vein.
Do not give by injection under the skin (subcutaneously).
The amount injected in any one place should not normally exceed one mililitre (1 ml).
The injections are given preferably in the thigh or the front part of the abdominal wall.
At the start of your therapy, Abseamed may be injected by medical staff.
However, your doctor may decide that it is right for you to learn how to inject Abseamed under the skin yourself.
You will receive appropriate training for you to do this.
Under no circumstances should you attempt to inject yourself unless you have been trained to do so.
1.
Wash your hands.
2.
Remove one syringe from the pack and remove the protective cap from the injection needle.
3.
Clean the skin at the injection site using an alcohol wipe.
4.
Form a skin fold by pinching the skin between thumb and forefinger.
5.
Insert the needle into the skin fold with a quick, firm action.
Inject the Abseamed solution.
Ensure that you only inject the amount as instructed by your doctor or nurse.
Withdraw the needle quickly and apply pressure over the injection site with a dry, sterile pad.
Discard any remaining liquid.
Only use each syringe for one injection.
If you inject more Abseamed than you should
You should inform the doctor immediately if you think too much Abseamed has been injected.
If you forget to use Abseamed
If you have missed an injection, or injected too little, talk to your doctor.
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose.
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.
4.
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, Abseamed can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
If you experience headaches, particularly sudden, stabbing migraine-like headaches or feel confused or have fits, tell your doctor immediately.
These may be the warning signs of a sudden rise in blood pressure which requires urgent treatment.
193 Other side effects:
General
- skin rash
- flu-like symptoms, such as headache, aches and pains in the joints, feeling of weakness,
tiredness, dizziness.
These may be more common at the start of treatment.
- An increase in levels of blood platelets (thrombocytes) which are normally involved in the
formation of a blood clot may occur.
Your doctor will check on this.
- Thrombotic events (blood clotting) in blood vessels, such as disturbed blood perfusion of the
heart, heart attack, cerebral haemorrhages, stroke, temporary disturbance of blood perfusion in the brain, deep vein thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, dilatation of the wall of a blood vessel (aneurysm), retinal thrombosis, and blood clot in an artificial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietin treatment.
- Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported in rare cases, including swelling, mainly in the
region of the eyelids and the lips (Quincke's oedema) and shock-like allergic reactions with symptoms of tingling, reddening, itching, hot flush and accelerated pulse.
- Pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) has been very rarely reported in patients after months to years of
subcutaneous (injection under the skin) erythropoietin treatment.
PRCA means the inability to produce enough red blood cells in the bone (see section “ Take special care with Abseamed”).
Kidney patients
- raised blood pressure which may require treatment with medicinal products or adjustment of the
dosage of medicinal products you already take for high blood pressure.
Your doctor may monitor your blood pressure regularly while you are using Abseamed, particularly at the start of therapy.
- Occlusion in the connection between artery and vein (shunt thrombosis) may occur especially if
you have low blood pressure or if your arteriovenous fistula has complications.
Your doctor may check your shunt and prescribe a medicinal product to prevent thrombosis.
Cancer patients
- blood clotting (thrombotic vascular events) (see section “ Take special care with Abseamed”).
- increase of blood pressure.
Therefore your haemoglobin-levels and your blood pressure should
be controlled.
Patients donating their own blood before surgery
with underlying cardiovascular disease: after donating blood repeatedly vascular and thrombotic events (blood clotting) can occur independently of treatment with Abseamed.
Therefore your doctor may prescribe a medicinal product for volume replacement (infusion).
Patients scheduled for orthopaedic surgery
Treatment with Abseamed may be associated with an increased risk of blood clotting after the surgery (postoperative thrombotic/ vascular disorders) if your levels of the red blood pigment are too high.
If any of the side effects gets serious, or if you notice any side effects not listed in this leaflet, please tell your doctor or pharmacist.
