What is Abilif@@ y@@ ?
Abilify is a medicine containing the active substance aripiprazole.
It is available as 5 mg@@ , 10 mg@@ , 15 mg and 30 mg table@@ ts, as 10 mg@@ , 15 mg and 30 mg orodispersible tablets (@@ tablets that dis@@ sol@@ ve in the mouth@@ ), as an oral solution (1 mg/ ml) and as a solution for injection (7.5 mg/ m@@ l).
What is Abilify used for@@ ?
Abilify is used to treat adults with the following mental illnes@@ ses: • schizophrenia, a mental ill@@ ness with a number of symptoms, including dis@@ organ@@ ised th@@ in@@ king and spee@@ ch@@ , hal@@ lu@@ cin@@ ations (@@ hear@@ ing or seeing th@@ ings that are not there@@ ), su@@ sp@@ ici@@ ousness and de@@ lu@@ sions (@@ mis@@ taken be@@ lief@@ s@@ ); • bipolar I disorder, a mental ill@@ ness in which patients have manic episodes (@@ perio@@ ds of ab@@ nor@@ m@@ ally high mo@@ o@@ d@@ ), altern@@ ating with perio@@ ds of normal mo@@ od.
Th@@ e@@ y may also have episodes of depression.
Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to pre@@ v@@ ent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the pa@@ st.
The solution for injection is used for the rapid control of agit@@ ation or di@@ st@@ ur@@ bed behaviour when taking the medicine by mouth is not appro@@ pri@@ a@@ te.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Abilify use@@ d?
For schizophrenia, the recommended starting dose is 10 or 15 mg by mouth per day.
The maintenance dose is 15 mg once a da@@ y, but higher doses may benefit some patients.
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
For both illnes@@ ses, the oral solution or orodispersible tablets can be used in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.
The orodispersible tablets are taken by being plac@@ ed on the tongue, where they dis@@ inte@@ gra@@ te quickly in the saliv@@ a, or by mix@@ ing them in water before swallow@@ ing.
The solution for injection is only for short-term use and should be replac@@ ed by table@@ ts, orodispersible tablets or oral solution as soon as possib@@ le@@ : the usual dose is 9.@@ 75 mg as a single injection into the upper ar@@ m or b@@ ut@@ t@@ oc@@ k muscle@@ , but effective doses range between 5.@@ 25 and 15 mg.

Re@@ production is author@@ ised provided the sour@@ ce is ack@@ no@@ w@@ le@@ d@@ ge@@ d.
Abilify can be taken with or without fo@@ od.
The daily dose of Abilify should not exceed 30 mg@@ , but this dose should be used with caution in patients who have severe problems with their li@@ ver@@ .
The dose of Abilify should be adjusted in patients who are taking other medicines that are brok@@ en do@@ wn in the same wa@@ y as Abilif@@ y.
Abilify has not been studied in children age@@ d below 18 years or adults age@@ d over 65 years.

How does Abilify wor@@ k@@ ?
The active substance in Abilif@@ y, aripiprazole, is an antipsychotic medicine.
Its ex@@ act me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m of action is un@@ kno@@ w@@ n, but it attach@@ es to several different receptors on the surface of n@@ er@@ ve cells in the b@@ ra@@ in.
This dis@@ ru@@ p@@ ts sign@@ als trans@@ mit@@ ted between b@@ ra@@ in cells by ‘ n@@ euro@@ trans@@ mit@@ ter@@ s@@ ’@@ , che@@ mic@@ als that al@@ low n@@ er@@ ve cells to com@@ m@@ un@@ ic@@ ate with each other@@ .
Aripiprazole is thoug@@ ht to act main@@ ly by being a ‘ partial agon@@ ist ’ for the receptors for the n@@ euro@@ trans@@ mit@@ ters dopamine and 5@@ -@@ hydroxy@@ tryp@@ tamine (@@ also called ser@@ oton@@ in@@ ).
This means that aripiprazole ac@@ ts like 5@@ -@@ hydroxy@@ tryp@@ tamine and dopamine to activ@@ ate the recep@@ tors, but to a less@@ er extent than the n@@ euro@@ trans@@ mit@@ ter@@ s.
S@@ ince dopamine and 5@@ -@@ hydroxy@@ tryp@@ tamine are invol@@ ved in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, aripiprazole hel@@ p@@ s to normal@@ ise the activity of the b@@ ra@@ in, reduc@@ ing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing them from return@@ ing.
How has Abilify been studi@@ ed@@ ?
For the treatment of schizophrenia, there were three main short-term studies of Abilify tablets la@@ sting four to si@@ x weeks, which invol@@ ved 1,@@ 20@@ 3 patients and compared Abilify with placebo (@@ a d@@ um@@ m@@ y treatment@@ ).
The effectiveness of Abilify in preventing symptoms from return@@ ing was assessed in three studies la@@ sting up to a year@@ , two of which used haloperidol (@@ another antipsychotic medicin@@ e) as a compar@@ ator@@ .
The effectiveness of the solution for injection was compared with placebo over a period of two hours in two studies involving 80@@ 5 patients with schizophrenia or related conditions who were experiencing symptoms of agit@@ ation.
All of the studies measured the change in the patient@@ ’ s symptoms using a standard scale for schizophren@@ ia.
For the treatment of bipolar disorder, there were eight main studies look@@ ing at Abilify taken by mouth@@ .
There were five short-term studies that compared the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo over three weeks in a total of 1,@@ 900 patients.
Two of these studies used haloperidol and lithium (@@ another antipsychotic medicin@@ e) as compar@@ ator@@ s and continued for a further n@@ ine weeks to lo@@ o@@ k at the maintenance of the effect of the medicin@@ es.
An@@ other study compared Abilify with haloperidol over 12 weeks in 3@@ 47 patients, and a further study compared the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo in preventing recurrence in 1@@ 60 patients whose manic symptoms had al@@ ready been stabil@@ ised using Abilif@@ y.
The eig@@ h@@ th study look@@ ed at the effect of ad@@ ding Abilify or placebo to existing treatment with lithium or valproate (@@ another antipsychotic medicin@@ e) in 38@@ 4 patients.
The effectiveness of Abilify solution for injection was compared with that of lor@@ azep@@ am (@@ another antipsychotic medicin@@ e) and of placebo over a period of two hours in one study involving 301 patients with bipolar disorder who were experiencing symptoms of agit@@ ation.
All of these studies look@@ ed at the change in symptoms using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or at the number of patients who responded to treatment.
The comp@@ any also carried out studies look@@ ing at the absorption of the orodispersible tablets and oral solution by the bo@@ dy.
What benefit has Abilify shown during the studi@@ es@@ ?
When used to treat schizophrenia, Abilify was more effective than placebo in the short-term studies.
In the lon@@ g-term studies, Abilify was more effective than placebo, and as effective as haloperidol@@ , after up to a ye@@ ar of treatment.
In both studies of the solution for injection, patients receiving Abilify at doses of 5.@@ 25@@ , 9.@@ 75 or 15 mg had a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of agit@@ ation than those receiving placebo.
When used to treat bipolar disorder, Abilify was more effective than placebo at reduc@@ ing manic symptoms in four of the five short-term studies.
Abilify also had a similar effect to haloperidol and to lithium over three weeks.
This effect was main@@ tained for up to 12 weeks.
Abilify was also more effective than placebo at preventing manic episodes return@@ ing in previ@@ ously treated patients for up to 74 weeks, and when it was used as an ad@@ d-@@ on to existing treatment.
In@@ jec@@ tions of Abilify at doses of 10 or 15 mg were also more effective than placebo in reduc@@ ing the symptoms of agitation, and were of similar effectiveness to lor@@ azep@@ am@@ .
2@@ / 3 What is the risk associated with Abilif@@ y@@ ?
The most common side effects when taking Abilify by mouth (@@ seen in between 1 and 10 patients in 100) are extrapyramidal disorder (@@ un@@ controlled twit@@ ching or jerk@@ ing@@ ), akathisia (@@ con@@ st@@ ant ur@@ ge to move@@ ), tre@@ m@@ or (@@ shak@@ ing@@ ), somnol@@ ence (@@ sleep@@ in@@ ess@@ ), sedation (@@ dro@@ w@@ sin@@ ess@@ ), headache, blurred visi@@ on, dyspep@@ si@@ a (@@ hear@@ t@@ bur@@ n@@ ), vomiting, nau@@ se@@ a (@@ feeling si@@ ck@@ ), constipation, saliv@@ ary hyper@@ sec@@ retion (@@ increased production of saliv@@ a@@ ), fatigue (@@ tired@@ nes@@ s), restlessness, insomn@@ ia (@@ difficulty sleep@@ ing) and anx@@ ie@@ t@@ y.
Akathis@@ ia is more common in patients with bipolar disorder than in those with schizophren@@ ia.
Be@@ t@@ ween 1 and 10 patients in 100 receiving injections of Abilify experience somnolence, dizziness, headache, akathisia, nau@@ se@@ a and vomit@@ ing.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Abilif@@ y, see the Package Leafle@@ t.
Abilify should not be used in people who may be hyper@@ sensi@@ tive (allerg@@ ic@@ ) to aripiprazole or any of the other ingredi@@ ents.
W@@ h@@ y has Abilify been appro@@ ve@@ d?
The Com@@ mitte@@ e for Medicinal Produc@@ ts for H@@ uman Use (CHMP) dec@@ ided that Abilif@@ y@@ ’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predomin@@ antly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment.
It also dec@@ ided that the benefits of the solution for injection out@@ weighed its risks for the rapid control of agit@@ ation and di@@ st@@ ur@@ bed behaviours in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder, when oral therapy is not appro@@ pri@@ a@@ te.
The Com@@ mitte@@ e recommended that Abilify be given marketing authoris@@ ation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophren@@ ia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predomin@@ antly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day.
En@@ han@@ ced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episode@@ s:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to me@@ als as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Rec@@ ur@@ rence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ments of daily do@@ sa@@ ge, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical stat@@ us.
Children and adolesc@@ ents: there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patients with severe hepatic impairment@@ , the data available are insufficient to establis@@ h recommend@@ ations.
However, the
2 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or ol@@ der has not been established.
O@@ wing to the greater sensitivity of this popul@@ ation, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors war@@ ran@@ t (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2).
Smoking stat@@ us: according to the metabolic pathwa@@ y of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smok@@ ers (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduc@@ ed.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 induc@@ ers with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increa@@ sed.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Dur@@ ing antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is in@@ her@@ ent in psychotic illnes@@ ses and mo@@ od disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or swit@@ ch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
C@@ lose supervision of high@@ -risk patients should accomp@@ any antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemi@@ ological study found that there was no increased risk of suicid@@ al@@ ity with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder@@ .
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (@@ history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduc@@ tion abnormaliti@@ es), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which w@@ ould predispose patients to hypotension (@@ de@@ hydration, hypo@@ vol@@ emi@@ a, and treatment with antihypertensive medic@@ ation@@ s) or hypertension, including accel@@ erated or malign@@ ant.
Con@@ duc@@ tion abnormaliti@@ es:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolong@@ ation.
T@@ ardi@@ ve Dyskinesi@@ a: in clinical trials of one ye@@ ar or less dur@@ ation, there were uncommon reports of treatment e@@ m@@ erg@@ ent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appe@@ ar in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptoms can temp@@ orally deter@@ i@@ or@@ ate or can even ar@@ ise after discontinuation of treatment.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NM@@ S):
NMS is a potentially fatal sy@@ mp@@ to@@ m comple@@ x associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
3 mental status and evidence of auton@@ o@@ mic in@@ stability (@@ irregular pul@@ se or blood pressure, tachycardia, di@@ ap@@ ho@@ re@@ sis and cardiac dy@@ s@@ rhythmi@@ a).
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosp@@ hokinase, myo@@ globinur@@ ia (@@ rhabdomyoly@@ sis@@ ), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosp@@ hokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessar@@ ily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develop@@ s signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high f@@ ever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Sei@@ zu@@ re: in clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizu@@ res.
El@@ derly patients with dementia-related psycho@@ sis:
Increased mortal@@ ity: in three placebo-controlled trials (n= 938@@ ; mean age:
8@@ 2.@@ 4 years; range:
5@@ 6-@@ 99 year@@ s) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheim@@ er@@ 's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5% compared to 1.@@ 7% in the placebo group.
Although the causes of deaths were var@@ ie@@ d, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death@@ ) or infec@@ ti@@ ous (e. g. pneumon@@ ia) in nat@@ ure.
C@@ erebrovascular adverse ev@@ ents: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack@@ ), including fataliti@@ es, were reported in patients (@@ mean age:
84 years; range:
78@@ -88 year@@ s).
Over@@ all, 1.@@ 3% of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.@@ 6% of placebo-treated patients in these trials.
This difference was not statistically signific@@ ant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-@@ dose trial, there was a significant dose response rel@@ ation@@ sh@@ ip for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psycho@@ sis.
Hyper@@ glycaemia and Diabetes Mell@@ it@@ us: hyperglycaemia, in some cases extre@@ me and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabete@@ s.
In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events (including diabete@@ s) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo.
Prec@@ ise risk estima@@ tes for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to al@@ low direc@@ t compar@@ ison@@ s.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (@@ such as poly@@ dip@@ sia, poly@@ uria, poly@@ pha@@ gia and weaknes@@ s) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is common@@ ly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co@@ - mor@@ bidi@@ ti@@ es, use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, po@@ or@@ ly managed life-@@ st@@ y@@ le, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY.
When se@@ en, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thy@@ ro@@ id disorder or p@@ itu@@ it@@ ary adenom@@ a.
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
Dyspha@@ g@@ ia: oesopha@@ geal dy@@ smo@@ tility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic dru@@ g use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic dru@@ gs should be used cauti@@ ously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumon@@ ia.
Lac@@ to@@ se: patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary problems of g@@ alac@@ tose intoler@@ ance, the l@@ ap@@ p lac@@ ta@@ se deficienc@@ y or gluco@@ se-@@ g@@ alac@@ tose mal@@ absorption should not take this medicinal produc@@ t.
Hyper@@ sensitiv@@ ity: as with other medic@@ ations hypersensitivity reac@@ tions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adren@@ ergic receptor antagonis@@ m, aripiprazole has the potential to enhan@@ ce the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
G@@ i@@ ven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with al@@ cohol or other CNS medicinal products with over@@ l@@ app@@ ing undesirable effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electroly@@ te i@@ mb@@ al@@ ance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY:
A ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ er, the H@@ 2 antagonist fa@@ motid@@ ine, reduc@@ es aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is de@@ emed not clinically relevan@@ t.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple path@@ ways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1@@ A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smok@@ ers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (@@ quinid@@ ine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax was unchange@@ d.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinid@@ ine occurs.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as flu@@ oxetin@@ e and par@@ oxetin@@ e, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (@@ ketoconaz@@ ol@@ e) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 6@@ 3% and 37@@ %, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43@@ %, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolis@@ ers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabol@@ iz@@ ers.
When consider@@ ing concomitant administration of ketoconaz@@ ole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should out@@ weig@@ h the potential risks to the patient@@ .
When concomitant administration of keto@@ con@@ oz@@ ole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as it@@ ra@@ conaz@@ ole and HIV prote@@ ase inhibitor@@ s, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor@@ , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When we@@ a@@ k inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e. g@@ ., di@@ l@@ tiazem or esc@@ italopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, mode@@ st increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expec@@ ted.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazep@@ ine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone.
Si@@ mi@@ lar@@ ly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazep@@ ine co@@ -@@ administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be dou@@ b@@ led when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazep@@ ine.
J@@ oh@@ n@@ 's Wort@@ ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 induc@@ ers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
5 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal produc@@ ts:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of subst@@ rates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan@@ / 3-@@ meth@@ oxymorphin@@ an ratio@@ ), 2C9 (@@ war@@ farin), 2C19 (@@ om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole@@ ), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan@@ ).
Addi@@ tion@@ al@@ ly, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for alter@@ ing CYP1A@@ 2-@@ mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product inter@@ actions mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium@@ , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
An@@ imal studies could not exclu@@ de potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to no@@ tif@@ y their physician if they become pregnant or inten@@ d to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concern@@ s ra@@ ised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly ju@@ sti@@ f@@ ies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole was excreted in the mil@@ k of treated rats during lact@@ ation.
Patients should be advised not to breast fe@@ ed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performe@@ d.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be cau@@ tion@@ ed about oper@@ ating haz@@ ard@@ ous machines, including mo@@ tor v@@ eh@@ ic@@ les, until they are reas@@ on@@ ably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adver@@ se@@ ly.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following undesirable effects occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions (*@@ ):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following conven@@ tion: common (> 1/ 100 ,@@ < 1/10@@ ) and uncommon (> 1/@@ 1 ,@@ 000, < 1/100).

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and post-marketing experienc@@ e, accidental or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,@@ 260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoe@@ a.
In addition, reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (@@ up to 195 mg) in children have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should conc@@ ent@@ rate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate air@@ wa@@ y, oxy@@ gen@@ ation and ven@@ til@@ ation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product invol@@ ve@@ ment should be considered.
There@@ fore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continu@@ ous elec@@ tro@@ cardi@@ ograph@@ ic monitoring to detec@@ t possible arrhythmias@@ .
Following any con@@ fir@@ med or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, clo@@ se medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recover@@ s.
Ac@@ tiv@@ ated charcoal (@@ 50 g@@ ), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 4@@ 1% and AUC by about 5@@ 1@@ %, sugge@@ sting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of over@@ dose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treat@@ ing an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be use@@ ful in overdose management since aripiprazole is high@@ ly bound to plasma protein@@ s.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
8 It has been propo@@ sed that aripiprazol@@ e’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonis@@ m at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonis@@ m of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyper@@ activity and agon@@ ist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypo@@ activ@@ ity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D@@ 3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D@@ 4, serotonin 5HT2@@ c and 5HT7@@ , alpha-@@ 1 adren@@ ergic and his@@ tamine H@@ 1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin re@@ up@@ take site and no ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ able affinity for mus@@ car@@ in@@ ic receptors.
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin sub@@ types may expla@@ in some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole doses rang@@ ing from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-@@ ra@@ clo@@ pri@@ de, a D2@@ / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and, to the cau@@ date and p@@ uta@@ men detected by posit@@ ron e@@ mission tom@@ og@@ ra@@ phy@@ .
Further information on clinical trial@@ s:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,@@ 228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with posi@@ tive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continu@@ ation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment respon@@ se.
In a haloperidol@@ -controlled trial, the proportion of respon@@ der patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-@@ weeks was similar in both groups (@@ aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Ac@@ tu@@ al s@@ co@@ res in ra@@ ting scal@@ es used as secondary end@@ po@@ in@@ ts, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asber@@ g Depres@@ sion R@@ ating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol@@ .
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in rel@@ ap@@ se rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzap@@ ine-@@ controlled, double-blind, multi@@ -@@ national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary en@@ d-@@ point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.@@ 6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~@@ 8@@ 0.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18@@ , or 13% of evaluable patient@@ s), compared to olanzap@@ ine (N= 45@@ , or 3@@ 3% of evaluable patients).
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexib@@ le-@@ dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks.
These trials included patients with or without psychotic feat@@ u@@ res and with or without a rapid@@ -@@ cy@@ cling cour@@ se.
In one 3-week, fixed-@@ dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-@@ week, placebo@@ - and activ@@ e-@@ controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-@@ week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were par@@ tially non-@@ respon@@ sive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum level@@ s, the addition of aripiprazole as adj@@ unc@@ tive therapy resul@@ ted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate mono@@ therapy.
9 In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 7@@ 4-@@ week exten@@ sion, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stab@@ ili@@ z@@ ation phase prior to ran@@ do@@ mi@@ z@@ ation, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recur@@ ren@@ c@@ e, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion:
Aripiprazole is well absor@@ be@@ d, with peak plasma concentrations occur@@ r@@ ing within 3-5 hours after dos@@ ing.
Aripiprazole undergo@@ es min@@ imal pre-@@ systemic metabolis@@ m.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet form@@ ulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high f@@ at me@@ al on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Dis@@ tribu@@ tion:
Aripiprazole is wide@@ ly distribu@@ ted throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extra@@ vascular distribu@@ tion.
At therapeutic concentr@@ ations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum protein@@ s, binding primarily to album@@ in.
Metabolis@@ m@@ :
Aripiprazole is exten@@ sively metabolised by the liver primarily by three bio@@ trans@@ formation pathwa@@ y@@ s: dehydrogen@@ ation, hydrox@@ yl@@ ation, and N-dealk@@ yl@@ ation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogen@@ ation and hydrox@@ ylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealk@@ ylation is cataly@@ sed by CYP3A@@ 4.
Aripiprazole is the predomin@@ ant medicinal product mo@@ iety in systemic circulation.
At ste@@ ady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, re@@ presents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plas@@ ma@@ .
Elimination:
The mean elimin@@ ation half-@@ li@@ ves for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 m@@ l/ min@@ / kg, which is primarily hep@@ ati@@ c.
Following a single oral dose of [@@ 14@@ C@@ ]@@ -@@ labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radio@@ activity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
L@@ ess than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Pharmacokineti@@ cs in special patient groups
Elderly:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and yo@@ unger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gen@@ der in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Rac@@ e:
Pop@@ ulation pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant rac@@ e-@@ related differences or effects from smo@@ king upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to yo@@ ung healthy subjec@@ ts.
10 Hep@@ atic Disease:
A single-@@ dose study in subjects with var@@ y@@ ing de@@ gre@@ es of liver cirrho@@ sis (Child-Pugh C@@ las@@ ses A, B, and C) did not reve@@ al a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with C@@ lass C liver cirrho@@ sis, which is insufficient to dra@@ w conc@@ lu@@ sions on their metabolic cap@@ ac@@ ity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-@@ clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmac@@ olog@@ y, repe@@ at-@@ dose toxicity, geno@@ toxicity, carcinogenic potenti@@ al, and toxicity to reproduc@@ tion.
Tox@@ ic@@ olog@@ ically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were suff@@ ici@@ ently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposu@@ re, indicating that these effects were limit@@ ed or of no relev@@ ance to clinical use.
These include@@ d: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (@@ l@@ ipofusc@@ in pig@@ ment accumul@@ ation and/ or par@@ enchy@@ mal cell loss@@ ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human do@@ se) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and com@@ bin@@ ed adrenocortical adenom@@ as@@ / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human do@@ se@@ ).
The highest n@@ on@@ tumor@@ igen@@ ic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional fin@@ ding was ch@@ olelithiasis as a con@@ sequ@@ ence of precip@@ it@@ ation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m@@ 2).
However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose propo@@ sed, 30 mg per da@@ y, were no more than 6% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39@@ -@@ week study and are well below (6%) their limit@@ s of in vitro solu@@ bil@@ ity.
Based on results of a full range of standard geno@@ toxicity te@@ st@@ s, aripiprazole was considered non-@@ geno@@ toxic@@ .
Aripiprazole did not impa@@ ir fer@@ tility in reproductive toxicity studies.
D@@ ev@@ e@@ lo@@ p@@ mental toxicity, including dose-dependent dela@@ y@@ ed foetal ossification and possible ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects, were observed in rats at doses resulting in sub@@ therapeutic exposures (@@ based on AUC) and in ra@@ bb@@ its at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Matern@@ al toxicity occurred at doses similar to those e@@ lic@@ it@@ ing developmental toxic@@ ity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophren@@ ia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predomin@@ antly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day.
En@@ han@@ ced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episode@@ s:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to me@@ als as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Rec@@ ur@@ rence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ments of daily do@@ sa@@ ge, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical stat@@ us.
Children and adolesc@@ ents: there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patients with severe hepatic impairment@@ , the data available are insufficient to establis@@ h recommend@@ ations.
However, the
13 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or ol@@ der has not been established.
O@@ wing to the greater sensitivity of this popul@@ ation, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors war@@ ran@@ t (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2).
Smoking stat@@ us: according to the metabolic pathwa@@ y of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smok@@ ers (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduc@@ ed.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 induc@@ ers with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increa@@ sed.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Dur@@ ing antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is in@@ her@@ ent in psychotic illnes@@ ses and mo@@ od disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or swit@@ ch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
C@@ lose supervision of high@@ -risk patients should accomp@@ any antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemi@@ ological study found that there was no increased risk of suicid@@ al@@ ity with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder@@ .
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (@@ history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduc@@ tion abnormaliti@@ es), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which w@@ ould predispose patients to hypotension (@@ de@@ hydration, hypo@@ vol@@ emi@@ a, and treatment with antihypertensive medic@@ ation@@ s) or hypertension, including accel@@ erated or malign@@ ant.
Con@@ duc@@ tion abnormaliti@@ es:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolong@@ ation.
T@@ ardi@@ ve Dyskinesi@@ a: in clinical trials of one ye@@ ar or less dur@@ ation, there were uncommon reports of treatment e@@ m@@ erg@@ ent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appe@@ ar in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptoms can temp@@ orally deter@@ i@@ or@@ ate or can even ar@@ ise after discontinuation of treatment.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NM@@ S):
NMS is a potentially fatal sy@@ mp@@ to@@ m comple@@ x associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
14 mental status and evidence of auton@@ o@@ mic in@@ stability (@@ irregular pul@@ se or blood pressure, tachycardia, di@@ ap@@ ho@@ re@@ sis and cardiac dy@@ s@@ rhythmi@@ a).
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosp@@ hokinase, myo@@ globinur@@ ia (@@ rhabdomyoly@@ sis@@ ), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosp@@ hokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessar@@ ily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develop@@ s signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high f@@ ever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Sei@@ zu@@ re: in clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizu@@ res.
El@@ derly patients with dementia-related psycho@@ sis:
Increased mortal@@ ity: in three placebo-controlled trials (n= 938@@ ; mean age:
8@@ 2.@@ 4 years; range:
5@@ 6-@@ 99 year@@ s) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheim@@ er@@ 's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5% compared to 1.@@ 7% in the placebo group.
Although the causes of deaths were var@@ ie@@ d, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death@@ ) or infec@@ ti@@ ous (e. g. pneumon@@ ia) in nat@@ ure.
C@@ erebrovascular adverse ev@@ ents: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack@@ ), including fataliti@@ es, were reported in patients (@@ mean age:
84 years; range:
78@@ -88 year@@ s).
Over@@ all, 1.@@ 3% of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.@@ 6% of placebo-treated patients in these trials.
This difference was not statistically signific@@ ant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-@@ dose trial, there was a significant dose response rel@@ ation@@ sh@@ ip for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psycho@@ sis.
Hyper@@ glycaemia and Diabetes Mell@@ it@@ us: hyperglycaemia, in some cases extre@@ me and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabete@@ s.
In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events (including diabete@@ s) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo.
Prec@@ ise risk estima@@ tes for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to al@@ low direc@@ t compar@@ ison@@ s.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (@@ such as poly@@ dip@@ sia, poly@@ uria, poly@@ pha@@ gia and weaknes@@ s) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is common@@ ly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co@@ - mor@@ bidi@@ ti@@ es, use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, po@@ or@@ ly managed life-@@ st@@ y@@ le, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY.
When se@@ en, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thy@@ ro@@ id disorder or p@@ itu@@ it@@ ary adenom@@ a.
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
Dyspha@@ g@@ ia: oesopha@@ geal dy@@ smo@@ tility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic dru@@ g use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic dru@@ gs should be used cauti@@ ously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumon@@ ia.
Lac@@ to@@ se: patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary problems of g@@ alac@@ tose intoler@@ ance, the l@@ ap@@ p lac@@ ta@@ se deficienc@@ y or gluco@@ se-@@ g@@ alac@@ tose mal@@ absorption should not take this medicinal produc@@ t.
Hyper@@ sensitiv@@ ity: as with other medic@@ ations hypersensitivity reac@@ tions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
15 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adren@@ ergic receptor antagonis@@ m, aripiprazole has the potential to enhan@@ ce the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
G@@ i@@ ven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with al@@ cohol or other CNS medicinal products with over@@ l@@ app@@ ing undesirable effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electroly@@ te i@@ mb@@ al@@ ance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY:
A ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ er, the H@@ 2 antagonist fa@@ motid@@ ine, reduc@@ es aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is de@@ emed not clinically relevan@@ t.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple path@@ ways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1@@ A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smok@@ ers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (@@ quinid@@ ine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax was unchange@@ d.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinid@@ ine occurs.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as flu@@ oxetin@@ e and par@@ oxetin@@ e, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (@@ ketoconaz@@ ol@@ e) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 6@@ 3% and 37@@ %, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43@@ %, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolis@@ ers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabol@@ iz@@ ers.
When consider@@ ing concomitant administration of ketoconaz@@ ole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should out@@ weig@@ h the potential risks to the patient@@ .
When concomitant administration of keto@@ con@@ oz@@ ole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as it@@ ra@@ conaz@@ ole and HIV prote@@ ase inhibitor@@ s, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor@@ , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When we@@ a@@ k inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e. g@@ ., di@@ l@@ tiazem or esc@@ italopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, mode@@ st increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expec@@ ted.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazep@@ ine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone.
Si@@ mi@@ lar@@ ly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazep@@ ine co@@ -@@ administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be dou@@ b@@ led when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazep@@ ine.
J@@ oh@@ n@@ 's Wort@@ ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 induc@@ ers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
16 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal produc@@ ts:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of subst@@ rates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan@@ / 3-@@ meth@@ oxymorphin@@ an ratio@@ ), 2C9 (@@ war@@ farin), 2C19 (@@ om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole@@ ), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan@@ ).
Addi@@ tion@@ al@@ ly, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for alter@@ ing CYP1A@@ 2-@@ mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product inter@@ actions mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium@@ , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
An@@ imal studies could not exclu@@ de potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to no@@ tif@@ y their physician if they become pregnant or inten@@ d to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concern@@ s ra@@ ised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly ju@@ sti@@ f@@ ies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole was excreted in the mil@@ k of treated rats during lact@@ ation.
Patients should be advised not to breast fe@@ ed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performe@@ d.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be cau@@ tion@@ ed about oper@@ ating haz@@ ard@@ ous machines, including mo@@ tor v@@ eh@@ ic@@ les, until they are reas@@ on@@ ably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adver@@ se@@ ly.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following undesirable effects occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions (*@@ ):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following conven@@ tion: common (> 1/ 100 ,@@ < 1/10@@ ) and uncommon (> 1/@@ 1 ,@@ 000, < 1/100).
Cardiac disorders Uncommon: tachycardia@@ * Nervous Sy@@ stem disorders Common: extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, tre@@ mor@@ , dizziness, somnolence, sed@@ ation, headach@@ e Eye disorders Common: blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common: dyspep@@ sia, vomiting, nausea, constipation, saliv@@ ary hyper@@ sec@@ retion Vascular disorders Uncommon: orthostatic hypoten@@ sion* General disorders and administration site conditions Common: fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common: restlessness, insomn@@ ia, anxiety Uncommon: depres@@ sion*
17 Extrapyramid@@ al symptoms (EPS):
Schizophren@@ ia - in a long term 52-@@ week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patients had an over@@ all@@ -@@ lower incidence (2@@ 5.@@ 8%) of EPS including par@@ kinsonis@@ m, akathisia, dy@@ ston@@ ia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57@@ .@@ 3%).
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 19% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13@@ .1% for placebo-treated patients.
In another lon@@ g-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 1@@ 4.8@@ % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 1@@ 5.1@@ % for olanzap@@ in@@ e-treated patients.
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 2@@ 3.5% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 5@@ 3.@@ 3% for haloperidol@@ -treated patients.
In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS was 2@@ 6.@@ 6% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17@@ .6% for those treated with lithium@@ .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.@@ 7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12@@ .1% with aripiprazole and 3.@@ 2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.@@ 2% with aripiprazole and 3.@@ 0% with placebo.
Com@@ par@@ ison@@ s between aripiprazole and placebo in the propor@@ tions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differenc@@ es.
E@@ lev@@ ations of CPK (C@@ reatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomati@@ c, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.@@ 0% of patients who received placebo.
Other find@@ ing@@ s:
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neur@@ oleptic malignant syn@@ dro@@ me, tardive dyskinesi@@ a, seizure, cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demen@@ ted patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and post-marketing experienc@@ e, accidental or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,@@ 260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoe@@ a.
In addition, reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (@@ up to 195 mg) in children have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should conc@@ ent@@ rate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate air@@ wa@@ y, oxy@@ gen@@ ation and ven@@ til@@ ation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product invol@@ ve@@ ment should be considered.
There@@ fore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continu@@ ous elec@@ tro@@ cardi@@ ograph@@ ic monitoring to detec@@ t possible arrhythmias@@ .
Following any con@@ fir@@ med or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, clo@@ se medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recover@@ s.
Ac@@ tiv@@ ated charcoal (@@ 50 g@@ ), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 4@@ 1% and AUC by about 5@@ 1@@ %, sugge@@ sting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of over@@ dose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treat@@ ing an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be use@@ ful in overdose management since aripiprazole is high@@ ly bound to plasma protein@@ s.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
19 It has been propo@@ sed that aripiprazol@@ e’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonis@@ m at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonis@@ m of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyper@@ activity and agon@@ ist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypo@@ activ@@ ity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D@@ 3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D@@ 4, serotonin 5HT2@@ c and 5HT7@@ , alpha-@@ 1 adren@@ ergic and his@@ tamine H@@ 1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin re@@ up@@ take site and no ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ able affinity for mus@@ car@@ in@@ ic receptors.
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin sub@@ types may expla@@ in some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole doses rang@@ ing from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-@@ ra@@ clo@@ pri@@ de, a D2@@ / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and, to the cau@@ date and p@@ uta@@ men detected by posit@@ ron e@@ mission tom@@ og@@ ra@@ phy@@ .
Further information on clinical trial@@ s:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,@@ 228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with posi@@ tive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continu@@ ation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment respon@@ se.
In a haloperidol@@ -controlled trial, the proportion of respon@@ der patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-@@ weeks was similar in both groups (@@ aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Ac@@ tu@@ al s@@ co@@ res in ra@@ ting scal@@ es used as secondary end@@ po@@ in@@ ts, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asber@@ g Depres@@ sion R@@ ating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol@@ .
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in rel@@ ap@@ se rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzap@@ ine-@@ controlled, double-blind, multi@@ -@@ national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary en@@ d-@@ point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.@@ 6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~@@ 8@@ 0.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18@@ , or 13% of evaluable patient@@ s), compared to olanzap@@ ine (N= 45@@ , or 3@@ 3% of evaluable patients).
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexib@@ le-@@ dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks.
These trials included patients with or without psychotic feat@@ u@@ res and with or without a rapid@@ -@@ cy@@ cling cour@@ se.
In one 3-week, fixed-@@ dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-@@ week, placebo@@ - and activ@@ e-@@ controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-@@ week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were par@@ tially non-@@ respon@@ sive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum level@@ s, the addition of aripiprazole as adj@@ unc@@ tive therapy resul@@ ted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate mono@@ therapy.
20 In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 7@@ 4-@@ week exten@@ sion, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stab@@ ili@@ z@@ ation phase prior to ran@@ do@@ mi@@ z@@ ation, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recur@@ ren@@ c@@ e, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion:
Aripiprazole is well absor@@ be@@ d, with peak plasma concentrations occur@@ r@@ ing within 3-5 hours after dos@@ ing.
Aripiprazole undergo@@ es min@@ imal pre-@@ systemic metabolis@@ m.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet form@@ ulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high f@@ at me@@ al on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Dis@@ tribu@@ tion:
Aripiprazole is wide@@ ly distribu@@ ted throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extra@@ vascular distribu@@ tion.
At therapeutic concentr@@ ations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum protein@@ s, binding primarily to album@@ in.
Metabolis@@ m@@ :
Aripiprazole is exten@@ sively metabolised by the liver primarily by three bio@@ trans@@ formation pathwa@@ y@@ s: dehydrogen@@ ation, hydrox@@ yl@@ ation, and N-dealk@@ yl@@ ation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogen@@ ation and hydrox@@ ylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealk@@ ylation is cataly@@ sed by CYP3A@@ 4.
Aripiprazole is the predomin@@ ant medicinal product mo@@ iety in systemic circulation.
At ste@@ ady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, re@@ presents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plas@@ ma@@ .
Elimination:
The mean elimin@@ ation half-@@ li@@ ves for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 m@@ l/ min@@ / kg, which is primarily hep@@ ati@@ c.
Following a single oral dose of [@@ 14@@ C@@ ]@@ -@@ labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radio@@ activity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
L@@ ess than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Pharmacokineti@@ cs in special patient groups
Elderly:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and yo@@ unger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gen@@ der in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Rac@@ e:
Pop@@ ulation pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant rac@@ e-@@ related differences or effects from smo@@ king upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to yo@@ ung healthy subjec@@ ts.
21 Hep@@ atic Disease:
A single-@@ dose study in subjects with var@@ y@@ ing de@@ gre@@ es of liver cirrho@@ sis (Child-Pugh C@@ las@@ ses A, B, and C) did not reve@@ al a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with C@@ lass C liver cirrho@@ sis, which is insufficient to dra@@ w conc@@ lu@@ sions on their metabolic cap@@ ac@@ ity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-@@ clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmac@@ olog@@ y, repe@@ at-@@ dose toxicity, geno@@ toxicity, carcinogenic potenti@@ al, and toxicity to reproduc@@ tion.
Tox@@ ic@@ olog@@ ically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were suff@@ ici@@ ently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposu@@ re, indicating that these effects were limit@@ ed or of no relev@@ ance to clinical use.
These include@@ d: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (@@ l@@ ipofusc@@ in pig@@ ment accumul@@ ation and/ or par@@ enchy@@ mal cell loss@@ ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human do@@ se) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and com@@ bin@@ ed adrenocortical adenom@@ as@@ / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human do@@ se@@ ).
The highest n@@ on@@ tumor@@ igen@@ ic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional fin@@ ding was ch@@ olelithiasis as a con@@ sequ@@ ence of precip@@ it@@ ation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m@@ 2).
However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose propo@@ sed, 30 mg per da@@ y, were no more than 6% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39@@ -@@ week study and are well below (6%) their limit@@ s of in vitro solu@@ bil@@ ity.
Based on results of a full range of standard geno@@ toxicity te@@ st@@ s, aripiprazole was considered non-@@ geno@@ toxic@@ .
Aripiprazole did not impa@@ ir fer@@ tility in reproductive toxicity studies.
D@@ ev@@ e@@ lo@@ p@@ mental toxicity, including dose-dependent dela@@ y@@ ed foetal ossification and possible ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects, were observed in rats at doses resulting in sub@@ therapeutic exposures (@@ based on AUC) and in ra@@ bb@@ its at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Matern@@ al toxicity occurred at doses similar to those e@@ lic@@ it@@ ing developmental toxic@@ ity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophren@@ ia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predomin@@ antly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day.
En@@ han@@ ced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episode@@ s:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to me@@ als as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Rec@@ ur@@ rence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ments of daily do@@ sa@@ ge, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical stat@@ us.
Children and adolesc@@ ents: there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patients with severe hepatic impairment@@ , the data available are insufficient to establis@@ h recommend@@ ations.
However, the
24 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or ol@@ der has not been established.
O@@ wing to the greater sensitivity of this popul@@ ation, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors war@@ ran@@ t (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2).
Smoking stat@@ us: according to the metabolic pathwa@@ y of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smok@@ ers (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduc@@ ed.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 induc@@ ers with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increa@@ sed.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Dur@@ ing antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is in@@ her@@ ent in psychotic illnes@@ ses and mo@@ od disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or swit@@ ch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
C@@ lose supervision of high@@ -risk patients should accomp@@ any antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemi@@ ological study found that there was no increased risk of suicid@@ al@@ ity with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder@@ .
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (@@ history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduc@@ tion abnormaliti@@ es), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which w@@ ould predispose patients to hypotension (@@ de@@ hydration, hypo@@ vol@@ emi@@ a, and treatment with antihypertensive medic@@ ation@@ s) or hypertension, including accel@@ erated or malign@@ ant.
Con@@ duc@@ tion abnormaliti@@ es:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolong@@ ation.
T@@ ardi@@ ve Dyskinesi@@ a: in clinical trials of one ye@@ ar or less dur@@ ation, there were uncommon reports of treatment e@@ m@@ erg@@ ent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appe@@ ar in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptoms can temp@@ orally deter@@ i@@ or@@ ate or can even ar@@ ise after discontinuation of treatment.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NM@@ S):
NMS is a potentially fatal sy@@ mp@@ to@@ m comple@@ x associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
25 mental status and evidence of auton@@ o@@ mic in@@ stability (@@ irregular pul@@ se or blood pressure, tachycardia, di@@ ap@@ ho@@ re@@ sis and cardiac dy@@ s@@ rhythmi@@ a).
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosp@@ hokinase, myo@@ globinur@@ ia (@@ rhabdomyoly@@ sis@@ ), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosp@@ hokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessar@@ ily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develop@@ s signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high f@@ ever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Sei@@ zu@@ re: in clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizu@@ res.
El@@ derly patients with dementia-related psycho@@ sis:
Increased mortal@@ ity: in three placebo-controlled trials (n= 938@@ ; mean age:
8@@ 2.@@ 4 years; range:
5@@ 6-@@ 99 year@@ s) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheim@@ er@@ 's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5% compared to 1.@@ 7% in the placebo group.
Although the causes of deaths were var@@ ie@@ d, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death@@ ) or infec@@ ti@@ ous (e. g. pneumon@@ ia) in nat@@ ure.
C@@ erebrovascular adverse ev@@ ents: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack@@ ), including fataliti@@ es, were reported in patients (@@ mean age:
84 years; range:
78@@ -88 year@@ s).
Over@@ all, 1.@@ 3% of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.@@ 6% of placebo-treated patients in these trials.
This difference was not statistically signific@@ ant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-@@ dose trial, there was a significant dose response rel@@ ation@@ sh@@ ip for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psycho@@ sis.
Hyper@@ glycaemia and Diabetes Mell@@ it@@ us: hyperglycaemia, in some cases extre@@ me and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabete@@ s.
In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events (including diabete@@ s) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo.
Prec@@ ise risk estima@@ tes for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to al@@ low direc@@ t compar@@ ison@@ s.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (@@ such as poly@@ dip@@ sia, poly@@ uria, poly@@ pha@@ gia and weaknes@@ s) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is common@@ ly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co@@ - mor@@ bidi@@ ti@@ es, use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, po@@ or@@ ly managed life-@@ st@@ y@@ le, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY.
When se@@ en, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thy@@ ro@@ id disorder or p@@ itu@@ it@@ ary adenom@@ a.
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
Dyspha@@ g@@ ia: oesopha@@ geal dy@@ smo@@ tility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic dru@@ g use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic dru@@ gs should be used cauti@@ ously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumon@@ ia.
Lac@@ to@@ se: patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary problems of g@@ alac@@ tose intoler@@ ance, the l@@ ap@@ p lac@@ ta@@ se deficienc@@ y or gluco@@ se-@@ g@@ alac@@ tose mal@@ absorption should not take this medicinal produc@@ t.
Hyper@@ sensitiv@@ ity: as with other medic@@ ations hypersensitivity reac@@ tions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
26 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adren@@ ergic receptor antagonis@@ m, aripiprazole has the potential to enhan@@ ce the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
G@@ i@@ ven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with al@@ cohol or other CNS medicinal products with over@@ l@@ app@@ ing undesirable effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electroly@@ te i@@ mb@@ al@@ ance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY:
A ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ er, the H@@ 2 antagonist fa@@ motid@@ ine, reduc@@ es aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is de@@ emed not clinically relevan@@ t.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple path@@ ways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1@@ A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smok@@ ers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (@@ quinid@@ ine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax was unchange@@ d.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinid@@ ine occurs.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as flu@@ oxetin@@ e and par@@ oxetin@@ e, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (@@ ketoconaz@@ ol@@ e) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 6@@ 3% and 37@@ %, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43@@ %, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolis@@ ers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabol@@ iz@@ ers.
When consider@@ ing concomitant administration of ketoconaz@@ ole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should out@@ weig@@ h the potential risks to the patient@@ .
When concomitant administration of keto@@ con@@ oz@@ ole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as it@@ ra@@ conaz@@ ole and HIV prote@@ ase inhibitor@@ s, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor@@ , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When we@@ a@@ k inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e. g@@ ., di@@ l@@ tiazem or esc@@ italopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, mode@@ st increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expec@@ ted.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazep@@ ine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone.
Si@@ mi@@ lar@@ ly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazep@@ ine co@@ -@@ administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be dou@@ b@@ led when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazep@@ ine.
J@@ oh@@ n@@ 's Wort@@ ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 induc@@ ers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
27 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal produc@@ ts:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of subst@@ rates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan@@ / 3-@@ meth@@ oxymorphin@@ an ratio@@ ), 2C9 (@@ war@@ farin), 2C19 (@@ om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole@@ ), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan@@ ).
Addi@@ tion@@ al@@ ly, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for alter@@ ing CYP1A@@ 2-@@ mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product inter@@ actions mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium@@ , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
An@@ imal studies could not exclu@@ de potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to no@@ tif@@ y their physician if they become pregnant or inten@@ d to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concern@@ s ra@@ ised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly ju@@ sti@@ f@@ ies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole was excreted in the mil@@ k of treated rats during lact@@ ation.
Patients should be advised not to breast fe@@ ed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performe@@ d.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be cau@@ tion@@ ed about oper@@ ating haz@@ ard@@ ous machines, including mo@@ tor v@@ eh@@ ic@@ les, until they are reas@@ on@@ ably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adver@@ se@@ ly.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following undesirable effects occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions (*@@ ):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following conven@@ tion: common (> 1/ 100 ,@@ < 1/10@@ ) and uncommon (> 1/@@ 1 ,@@ 000, < 1/100).

In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS was 2@@ 6.@@ 6% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17@@ .6% for those treated with lithium@@ .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.@@ 7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12@@ .1% with aripiprazole and 3.@@ 2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.@@ 2% with aripiprazole and 3.@@ 0% with placebo.
Com@@ par@@ ison@@ s between aripiprazole and placebo in the propor@@ tions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differenc@@ es.
E@@ lev@@ ations of CPK (C@@ reatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomati@@ c, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.@@ 0% of patients who received placebo.
Other find@@ ing@@ s:
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neur@@ oleptic malignant syn@@ dro@@ me, tardive dyskinesi@@ a, seizure, cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demen@@ ted patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and post-marketing experienc@@ e, accidental or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,@@ 260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoe@@ a.
In addition, reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (@@ up to 195 mg) in children have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should conc@@ ent@@ rate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate air@@ wa@@ y, oxy@@ gen@@ ation and ven@@ til@@ ation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product invol@@ ve@@ ment should be considered.
There@@ fore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continu@@ ous elec@@ tro@@ cardi@@ ograph@@ ic monitoring to detec@@ t possible arrhythmias@@ .
Following any con@@ fir@@ med or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, clo@@ se medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recover@@ s.
Ac@@ tiv@@ ated charcoal (@@ 50 g@@ ), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 4@@ 1% and AUC by about 5@@ 1@@ %, sugge@@ sting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of over@@ dose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treat@@ ing an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be use@@ ful in overdose management since aripiprazole is high@@ ly bound to plasma protein@@ s.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
30 It has been propo@@ sed that aripiprazol@@ e’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonis@@ m at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonis@@ m of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyper@@ activity and agon@@ ist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypo@@ activ@@ ity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D@@ 3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D@@ 4, serotonin 5HT2@@ c and 5HT7@@ , alpha-@@ 1 adren@@ ergic and his@@ tamine H@@ 1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin re@@ up@@ take site and no ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ able affinity for mus@@ car@@ in@@ ic receptors.
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin sub@@ types may expla@@ in some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole doses rang@@ ing from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-@@ ra@@ clo@@ pri@@ de, a D2@@ / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and, to the cau@@ date and p@@ uta@@ men detected by posit@@ ron e@@ mission tom@@ og@@ ra@@ phy@@ .
Further information on clinical trial@@ s:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,@@ 228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with posi@@ tive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continu@@ ation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment respon@@ se.
In a haloperidol@@ -controlled trial, the proportion of respon@@ der patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-@@ weeks was similar in both groups (@@ aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Ac@@ tu@@ al s@@ co@@ res in ra@@ ting scal@@ es used as secondary end@@ po@@ in@@ ts, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asber@@ g Depres@@ sion R@@ ating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol@@ .
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in rel@@ ap@@ se rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzap@@ ine-@@ controlled, double-blind, multi@@ -@@ national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary en@@ d-@@ point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.@@ 6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~@@ 8@@ 0.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18@@ , or 13% of evaluable patient@@ s), compared to olanzap@@ ine (N= 45@@ , or 3@@ 3% of evaluable patients).
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexib@@ le-@@ dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks.
These trials included patients with or without psychotic feat@@ u@@ res and with or without a rapid@@ -@@ cy@@ cling cour@@ se.
In one 3-week, fixed-@@ dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-@@ week, placebo@@ - and activ@@ e-@@ controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-@@ week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were par@@ tially non-@@ respon@@ sive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum level@@ s, the addition of aripiprazole as adj@@ unc@@ tive therapy resul@@ ted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate mono@@ therapy.
31 In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 7@@ 4-@@ week exten@@ sion, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stab@@ ili@@ z@@ ation phase prior to ran@@ do@@ mi@@ z@@ ation, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recur@@ ren@@ c@@ e, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion:
Aripiprazole is well absor@@ be@@ d, with peak plasma concentrations occur@@ r@@ ing within 3-5 hours after dos@@ ing.
Aripiprazole undergo@@ es min@@ imal pre-@@ systemic metabolis@@ m.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet form@@ ulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high f@@ at me@@ al on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Dis@@ tribu@@ tion:
Aripiprazole is wide@@ ly distribu@@ ted throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extra@@ vascular distribu@@ tion.
At therapeutic concentr@@ ations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum protein@@ s, binding primarily to album@@ in.
Metabolis@@ m@@ :
Aripiprazole is exten@@ sively metabolised by the liver primarily by three bio@@ trans@@ formation pathwa@@ y@@ s: dehydrogen@@ ation, hydrox@@ yl@@ ation, and N-dealk@@ yl@@ ation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogen@@ ation and hydrox@@ ylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealk@@ ylation is cataly@@ sed by CYP3A@@ 4.
Aripiprazole is the predomin@@ ant medicinal product mo@@ iety in systemic circulation.
At ste@@ ady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, re@@ presents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plas@@ ma@@ .
Elimination:
The mean elimin@@ ation half-@@ li@@ ves for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 m@@ l/ min@@ / kg, which is primarily hep@@ ati@@ c.
Following a single oral dose of [@@ 14@@ C@@ ]@@ -@@ labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radio@@ activity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
L@@ ess than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Pharmacokineti@@ cs in special patient groups
Elderly:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and yo@@ unger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gen@@ der in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Rac@@ e:
Pop@@ ulation pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant rac@@ e-@@ related differences or effects from smo@@ king upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to yo@@ ung healthy subjec@@ ts.
32 Hep@@ atic Disease:
A single-@@ dose study in subjects with var@@ y@@ ing de@@ gre@@ es of liver cirrho@@ sis (Child-Pugh C@@ las@@ ses A, B, and C) did not reve@@ al a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with C@@ lass C liver cirrho@@ sis, which is insufficient to dra@@ w conc@@ lu@@ sions on their metabolic cap@@ ac@@ ity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-@@ clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmac@@ olog@@ y, repe@@ at-@@ dose toxicity, geno@@ toxicity, carcinogenic potenti@@ al, and toxicity to reproduc@@ tion.
Tox@@ ic@@ olog@@ ically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were suff@@ ici@@ ently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposu@@ re, indicating that these effects were limit@@ ed or of no relev@@ ance to clinical use.
These include@@ d: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (@@ l@@ ipofusc@@ in pig@@ ment accumul@@ ation and/ or par@@ enchy@@ mal cell loss@@ ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human do@@ se) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and com@@ bin@@ ed adrenocortical adenom@@ as@@ / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human do@@ se@@ ).
The highest n@@ on@@ tumor@@ igen@@ ic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional fin@@ ding was ch@@ olelithiasis as a con@@ sequ@@ ence of precip@@ it@@ ation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m@@ 2).
However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose propo@@ sed, 30 mg per da@@ y, were no more than 6% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39@@ -@@ week study and are well below (6%) their limit@@ s of in vitro solu@@ bil@@ ity.
Based on results of a full range of standard geno@@ toxicity te@@ st@@ s, aripiprazole was considered non-@@ geno@@ toxic@@ .
Aripiprazole did not impa@@ ir fer@@ tility in reproductive toxicity studies.
D@@ ev@@ e@@ lo@@ p@@ mental toxicity, including dose-dependent dela@@ y@@ ed foetal ossification and possible ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects, were observed in rats at doses resulting in sub@@ therapeutic exposures (@@ based on AUC) and in ra@@ bb@@ its at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Matern@@ al toxicity occurred at doses similar to those e@@ lic@@ it@@ ing developmental toxic@@ ity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophren@@ ia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predomin@@ antly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day.
En@@ han@@ ced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episode@@ s:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to me@@ als as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Rec@@ ur@@ rence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ments of daily do@@ sa@@ ge, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical stat@@ us.
Children and adolesc@@ ents: there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patients with severe hepatic impairment@@ , the data available are insufficient to establis@@ h recommend@@ ations.
However, the
35 maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or ol@@ der has not been established.
O@@ wing to the greater sensitivity of this popul@@ ation, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors war@@ ran@@ t (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2).
Smoking stat@@ us: according to the metabolic pathwa@@ y of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smok@@ ers (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduc@@ ed.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 induc@@ ers with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increa@@ sed.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Dur@@ ing antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is in@@ her@@ ent in psychotic illnes@@ ses and mo@@ od disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or swit@@ ch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
C@@ lose supervision of high@@ -risk patients should accomp@@ any antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemi@@ ological study found that there was no increased risk of suicid@@ al@@ ity with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder@@ .
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (@@ history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduc@@ tion abnormaliti@@ es), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which w@@ ould predispose patients to hypotension (@@ de@@ hydration, hypo@@ vol@@ emi@@ a, and treatment with antihypertensive medic@@ ation@@ s) or hypertension, including accel@@ erated or malign@@ ant.
Con@@ duc@@ tion abnormaliti@@ es:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolong@@ ation.
T@@ ardi@@ ve Dyskinesi@@ a: in clinical trials of one ye@@ ar or less dur@@ ation, there were uncommon reports of treatment e@@ m@@ erg@@ ent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appe@@ ar in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptoms can temp@@ orally deter@@ i@@ or@@ ate or can even ar@@ ise after discontinuation of treatment.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NM@@ S):
NMS is a potentially fatal sy@@ mp@@ to@@ m comple@@ x associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
36 mental status and evidence of auton@@ o@@ mic in@@ stability (@@ irregular pul@@ se or blood pressure, tachycardia, di@@ ap@@ ho@@ re@@ sis and cardiac dy@@ s@@ rhythmi@@ a).
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosp@@ hokinase, myo@@ globinur@@ ia (@@ rhabdomyoly@@ sis@@ ), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosp@@ hokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessar@@ ily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develop@@ s signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high f@@ ever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Sei@@ zu@@ re: in clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizu@@ res.
El@@ derly patients with dementia-related psycho@@ sis:
Increased mortal@@ ity: in three placebo-controlled trials (n= 938@@ ; mean age:
8@@ 2.@@ 4 years; range:
5@@ 6-@@ 99 year@@ s) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheim@@ er@@ 's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5% compared to 1.@@ 7% in the placebo group.
Although the causes of deaths were var@@ ie@@ d, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death@@ ) or infec@@ ti@@ ous (e. g. pneumon@@ ia) in nat@@ ure.
C@@ erebrovascular adverse ev@@ ents: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack@@ ), including fataliti@@ es, were reported in patients (@@ mean age:
84 years; range:
78@@ -88 year@@ s).
Over@@ all, 1.@@ 3% of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.@@ 6% of placebo-treated patients in these trials.
This difference was not statistically signific@@ ant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-@@ dose trial, there was a significant dose response rel@@ ation@@ sh@@ ip for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psycho@@ sis.
Hyper@@ glycaemia and Diabetes Mell@@ it@@ us: hyperglycaemia, in some cases extre@@ me and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabete@@ s.
In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events (including diabete@@ s) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo.
Prec@@ ise risk estima@@ tes for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to al@@ low direc@@ t compar@@ ison@@ s.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (@@ such as poly@@ dip@@ sia, poly@@ uria, poly@@ pha@@ gia and weaknes@@ s) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is common@@ ly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co@@ - mor@@ bidi@@ ti@@ es, use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, po@@ or@@ ly managed life-@@ st@@ y@@ le, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY.
When se@@ en, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thy@@ ro@@ id disorder or p@@ itu@@ it@@ ary adenom@@ a.
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
Dyspha@@ g@@ ia: oesopha@@ geal dy@@ smo@@ tility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic dru@@ g use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic dru@@ gs should be used cauti@@ ously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumon@@ ia.
Lac@@ to@@ se: patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary problems of g@@ alac@@ tose intoler@@ ance, the l@@ ap@@ p lac@@ ta@@ se deficienc@@ y or gluco@@ se-@@ g@@ alac@@ tose mal@@ absorption should not take this medicinal produc@@ t.
Hyper@@ sensitiv@@ ity: as with other medic@@ ations hypersensitivity reac@@ tions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
37 4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adren@@ ergic receptor antagonis@@ m, aripiprazole has the potential to enhan@@ ce the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
G@@ i@@ ven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with al@@ cohol or other CNS medicinal products with over@@ l@@ app@@ ing undesirable effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electroly@@ te i@@ mb@@ al@@ ance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY:
A ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ er, the H@@ 2 antagonist fa@@ motid@@ ine, reduc@@ es aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is de@@ emed not clinically relevan@@ t.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple path@@ ways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1@@ A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smok@@ ers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (@@ quinid@@ ine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax was unchange@@ d.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinid@@ ine occurs.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as flu@@ oxetin@@ e and par@@ oxetin@@ e, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (@@ ketoconaz@@ ol@@ e) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 6@@ 3% and 37@@ %, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43@@ %, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolis@@ ers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabol@@ iz@@ ers.
When consider@@ ing concomitant administration of ketoconaz@@ ole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should out@@ weig@@ h the potential risks to the patient@@ .
When concomitant administration of keto@@ con@@ oz@@ ole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as it@@ ra@@ conaz@@ ole and HIV prote@@ ase inhibitor@@ s, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor@@ , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When we@@ a@@ k inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e. g@@ ., di@@ l@@ tiazem or esc@@ italopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, mode@@ st increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expec@@ ted.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazep@@ ine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone.
Si@@ mi@@ lar@@ ly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazep@@ ine co@@ -@@ administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be dou@@ b@@ led when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazep@@ ine.
J@@ oh@@ n@@ 's Wort@@ ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 induc@@ ers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
38 When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal produc@@ ts:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of subst@@ rates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan@@ / 3-@@ meth@@ oxymorphin@@ an ratio@@ ), 2C9 (@@ war@@ farin), 2C19 (@@ om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole@@ ), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan@@ ).
Addi@@ tion@@ al@@ ly, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for alter@@ ing CYP1A@@ 2-@@ mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product inter@@ actions mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium@@ , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
An@@ imal studies could not exclu@@ de potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to no@@ tif@@ y their physician if they become pregnant or inten@@ d to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concern@@ s ra@@ ised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly ju@@ sti@@ f@@ ies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole was excreted in the mil@@ k of treated rats during lact@@ ation.
Patients should be advised not to breast fe@@ ed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performe@@ d.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be cau@@ tion@@ ed about oper@@ ating haz@@ ard@@ ous machines, including mo@@ tor v@@ eh@@ ic@@ les, until they are reas@@ on@@ ably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adver@@ se@@ ly.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following undesirable effects occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions (*@@ ):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following conven@@ tion: common (> 1/ 100 ,@@ < 1/10@@ ) and uncommon (> 1/@@ 1 ,@@ 000, < 1/100).
Cardiac disorders Uncommon: tachycardia@@ * Nervous Sy@@ stem disorders Common: extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, tre@@ mor@@ , dizziness, somnolence, sed@@ ation, headach@@ e Eye disorders Common: blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common: dyspep@@ sia, vomiting, nausea, constipation, saliv@@ ary hyper@@ sec@@ retion Vascular disorders Uncommon: orthostatic hypoten@@ sion* General disorders and administration site conditions Common: fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common: restlessness, insomn@@ ia, anxiety Uncommon: depres@@ sion*
39 Extrapyramid@@ al symptoms (EPS):
Schizophren@@ ia - in a long term 52-@@ week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patients had an over@@ all@@ -@@ lower incidence (2@@ 5.@@ 8%) of EPS including par@@ kinsonis@@ m, akathisia, dy@@ ston@@ ia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57@@ .@@ 3%).
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 19% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13@@ .1% for placebo-treated patients.
In another lon@@ g-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 1@@ 4.8@@ % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 1@@ 5.1@@ % for olanzap@@ in@@ e-treated patients.
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 2@@ 3.5% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 5@@ 3.@@ 3% for haloperidol@@ -treated patients.
In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS was 2@@ 6.@@ 6% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17@@ .6% for those treated with lithium@@ .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.@@ 7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12@@ .1% with aripiprazole and 3.@@ 2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.@@ 2% with aripiprazole and 3.@@ 0% with placebo.
Com@@ par@@ ison@@ s between aripiprazole and placebo in the propor@@ tions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differenc@@ es.
E@@ lev@@ ations of CPK (C@@ reatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomati@@ c, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.@@ 0% of patients who received placebo.
Other find@@ ing@@ s:
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neur@@ oleptic malignant syn@@ dro@@ me, tardive dyskinesi@@ a, seizure, cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demen@@ ted patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and post-marketing experienc@@ e, accidental or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,@@ 260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoe@@ a.
In addition, reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (@@ up to 195 mg) in children have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should conc@@ ent@@ rate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate air@@ wa@@ y, oxy@@ gen@@ ation and ven@@ til@@ ation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product invol@@ ve@@ ment should be considered.
There@@ fore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continu@@ ous elec@@ tro@@ cardi@@ ograph@@ ic monitoring to detec@@ t possible arrhythmias@@ .
Following any con@@ fir@@ med or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, clo@@ se medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recover@@ s.
Ac@@ tiv@@ ated charcoal (@@ 50 g@@ ), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 4@@ 1% and AUC by about 5@@ 1@@ %, sugge@@ sting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of over@@ dose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treat@@ ing an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be use@@ ful in overdose management since aripiprazole is high@@ ly bound to plasma protein@@ s.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
4@@ 1 It has been propo@@ sed that aripiprazol@@ e’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonis@@ m at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonis@@ m of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyper@@ activity and agon@@ ist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypo@@ activ@@ ity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D@@ 3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D@@ 4, serotonin 5HT2@@ c and 5HT7@@ , alpha-@@ 1 adren@@ ergic and his@@ tamine H@@ 1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin re@@ up@@ take site and no ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ able affinity for mus@@ car@@ in@@ ic receptors.
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin sub@@ types may expla@@ in some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole doses rang@@ ing from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-@@ ra@@ clo@@ pri@@ de, a D2@@ / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and, to the cau@@ date and p@@ uta@@ men detected by posit@@ ron e@@ mission tom@@ og@@ ra@@ phy@@ .
Further information on clinical trial@@ s:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,@@ 228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with posi@@ tive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continu@@ ation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment respon@@ se.
In a haloperidol@@ -controlled trial, the proportion of respon@@ der patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-@@ weeks was similar in both groups (@@ aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Ac@@ tu@@ al s@@ co@@ res in ra@@ ting scal@@ es used as secondary end@@ po@@ in@@ ts, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asber@@ g Depres@@ sion R@@ ating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol@@ .
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in rel@@ ap@@ se rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzap@@ ine-@@ controlled, double-blind, multi@@ -@@ national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary en@@ d-@@ point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.@@ 6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~@@ 8@@ 0.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18@@ , or 13% of evaluable patient@@ s), compared to olanzap@@ ine (N= 45@@ , or 3@@ 3% of evaluable patients).
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexib@@ le-@@ dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks.
These trials included patients with or without psychotic feat@@ u@@ res and with or without a rapid@@ -@@ cy@@ cling cour@@ se.
In one 3-week, fixed-@@ dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-@@ week, placebo@@ - and activ@@ e-@@ controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-@@ week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were par@@ tially non-@@ respon@@ sive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum level@@ s, the addition of aripiprazole as adj@@ unc@@ tive therapy resul@@ ted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate mono@@ therapy.
42 In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 7@@ 4-@@ week exten@@ sion, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stab@@ ili@@ z@@ ation phase prior to ran@@ do@@ mi@@ z@@ ation, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recur@@ ren@@ c@@ e, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion:
Aripiprazole is well absor@@ be@@ d, with peak plasma concentrations occur@@ r@@ ing within 3-5 hours after dos@@ ing.
Aripiprazole undergo@@ es min@@ imal pre-@@ systemic metabolis@@ m.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet form@@ ulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high f@@ at me@@ al on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Dis@@ tribu@@ tion:
Aripiprazole is wide@@ ly distribu@@ ted throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extra@@ vascular distribu@@ tion.
At therapeutic concentr@@ ations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum protein@@ s, binding primarily to album@@ in.
Metabolis@@ m@@ :
Aripiprazole is exten@@ sively metabolised by the liver primarily by three bio@@ trans@@ formation pathwa@@ y@@ s: dehydrogen@@ ation, hydrox@@ yl@@ ation, and N-dealk@@ yl@@ ation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogen@@ ation and hydrox@@ ylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealk@@ ylation is cataly@@ sed by CYP3A@@ 4.
Aripiprazole is the predomin@@ ant medicinal product mo@@ iety in systemic circulation.
At ste@@ ady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, re@@ presents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plas@@ ma@@ .
Elimination:
The mean elimin@@ ation half-@@ li@@ ves for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 m@@ l/ min@@ / kg, which is primarily hep@@ ati@@ c.
Following a single oral dose of [@@ 14@@ C@@ ]@@ -@@ labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radio@@ activity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
L@@ ess than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Pharmacokineti@@ cs in special patient groups
Elderly:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and yo@@ unger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gen@@ der in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Rac@@ e:
Pop@@ ulation pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant rac@@ e-@@ related differences or effects from smo@@ king upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to yo@@ ung healthy subjec@@ ts.
43 Hep@@ atic Disease:
A single-@@ dose study in subjects with var@@ y@@ ing de@@ gre@@ es of liver cirrho@@ sis (Child-Pugh C@@ las@@ ses A, B, and C) did not reve@@ al a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with C@@ lass C liver cirrho@@ sis, which is insufficient to dra@@ w conc@@ lu@@ sions on their metabolic cap@@ ac@@ ity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-@@ clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmac@@ olog@@ y, repe@@ at-@@ dose toxicity, geno@@ toxicity, carcinogenic potenti@@ al, and toxicity to reproduc@@ tion.
Tox@@ ic@@ olog@@ ically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were suff@@ ici@@ ently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposu@@ re, indicating that these effects were limit@@ ed or of no relev@@ ance to clinical use.
These include@@ d: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (@@ l@@ ipofusc@@ in pig@@ ment accumul@@ ation and/ or par@@ enchy@@ mal cell loss@@ ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human do@@ se) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and com@@ bin@@ ed adrenocortical adenom@@ as@@ / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human do@@ se@@ ).
The highest n@@ on@@ tumor@@ igen@@ ic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional fin@@ ding was ch@@ olelithiasis as a con@@ sequ@@ ence of precip@@ it@@ ation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m@@ 2).
However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose propo@@ sed, 30 mg per da@@ y, were no more than 6% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39@@ -@@ week study and are well below (6%) their limit@@ s of in vitro solu@@ bil@@ ity.
Based on results of a full range of standard geno@@ toxicity te@@ st@@ s, aripiprazole was considered non-@@ geno@@ toxic@@ .
Aripiprazole did not impa@@ ir fer@@ tility in reproductive toxicity studies.
D@@ ev@@ e@@ lo@@ p@@ mental toxicity, including dose-dependent dela@@ y@@ ed foetal ossification and possible ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects, were observed in rats at doses resulting in sub@@ therapeutic exposures (@@ based on AUC) and in ra@@ bb@@ its at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Matern@@ al toxicity occurred at doses similar to those e@@ lic@@ it@@ ing developmental toxic@@ ity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophren@@ ia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predomin@@ antly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day.
En@@ han@@ ced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episode@@ s:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to me@@ als as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Rec@@ ur@@ rence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ments of daily do@@ sa@@ ge, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical stat@@ us.
The orodispersible tablet should be plac@@ ed in the mouth on the tongue, where it will rapid@@ ly di@@ sper@@ se in saliv@@ a.
It can be taken with or without liqu@@ id@@ .
Re@@ mo@@ v@@ al of the int@@ act orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficul@@ t.
S@@ ince the orodispersible tablet is fra@@ gi@@ le, it should be taken immediately on open@@ ing the blister.
Alternatively, di@@ sper@@ se the tablet in water and drink the resulting su@@ spen@@ sion.
46 The orodispersible tablets may be used as an altern@@ ative to ABILIFY tablets for patients who have difficulty to swal@@ low ABILIFY tablets (see also section 5.2).
Children and adolesc@@ ents: there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patients with severe hepatic impairment@@ , the data available are insufficient to establis@@ h recommend@@ ations.
In these patients dosing should be managed cauti@@ ously.
However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or ol@@ der has not been established.
O@@ wing to the greater sensitivity of this popul@@ ation, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors war@@ ran@@ t (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2).
Smoking stat@@ us: according to the metabolic pathwa@@ y of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smok@@ ers (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduc@@ ed.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 induc@@ ers with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increa@@ sed.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Dur@@ ing antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is in@@ her@@ ent in psychotic illnes@@ ses and mo@@ od disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or swit@@ ch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
C@@ lose supervision of high@@ -risk patients should accomp@@ any antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemi@@ ological study found that there was no increased risk of suicid@@ al@@ ity with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder@@ .
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (@@ history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduc@@ tion abnormaliti@@ es), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which w@@ ould predispose patients to hypotension (@@ de@@ hydration, hypo@@ vol@@ emi@@ a, and treatment with antihypertensive medic@@ ation@@ s) or hypertension, including accel@@ erated or malign@@ ant.
Con@@ duc@@ tion abnormaliti@@ es:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolong@@ ation.
47 T@@ ardi@@ ve Dyskinesi@@ a: in clinical trials of one ye@@ ar or less dur@@ ation, there were uncommon reports of treatment e@@ m@@ erg@@ ent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appe@@ ar in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptoms can temp@@ orally deter@@ i@@ or@@ ate or can even ar@@ ise after discontinuation of treatment.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NM@@ S):
NMS is a potentially fatal sy@@ mp@@ to@@ m comple@@ x associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
C@@ linical manifestations of NMS are hyper@@ pyrex@@ ia, muscle rigidi@@ ty, altered mental status and evidence of auton@@ o@@ mic in@@ stability (@@ irregular pul@@ se or blood pressure, tachycardia, di@@ ap@@ ho@@ re@@ sis and cardiac dy@@ s@@ rhythmi@@ a).
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosp@@ hokinase, myo@@ globinur@@ ia (@@ rhabdomyoly@@ sis@@ ), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosp@@ hokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessar@@ ily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develop@@ s signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high f@@ ever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Sei@@ zu@@ re: in clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizu@@ res.
El@@ derly patients with dementia-related psycho@@ sis:
Increased mortal@@ ity: in three placebo-controlled trials (n= 938@@ ; mean age:
8@@ 2.@@ 4 years; range:
5@@ 6-@@ 99 year@@ s) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheim@@ er@@ 's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5% compared to 1.@@ 7% in the placebo group.
Although the causes of deaths were var@@ ie@@ d, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death@@ ) or infec@@ ti@@ ous (e. g. pneumon@@ ia) in nat@@ ure.
C@@ erebrovascular adverse ev@@ ents: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack@@ ), including fataliti@@ es, were reported in patients (@@ mean age:
84 years; range:
78@@ -88 year@@ s).
Over@@ all, 1.@@ 3% of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.@@ 6% of placebo-treated patients in these trials.
This difference was not statistically signific@@ ant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-@@ dose trial, there was a significant dose response rel@@ ation@@ sh@@ ip for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psycho@@ sis.
Hyper@@ glycaemia and Diabetes Mell@@ it@@ us: hyperglycaemia, in some cases extre@@ me and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabete@@ s.
In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events (including diabete@@ s) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo.
Prec@@ ise risk estima@@ tes for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to al@@ low direc@@ t compar@@ ison@@ s.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (@@ such as poly@@ dip@@ sia, poly@@ uria, poly@@ pha@@ gia and weaknes@@ s) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is common@@ ly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co@@ - mor@@ bidi@@ ti@@ es, use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, po@@ or@@ ly managed life-@@ st@@ y@@ le, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY.
When se@@ en, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thy@@ ro@@ id disorder or p@@ itu@@ it@@ ary adenom@@ a.
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
48 Dyspha@@ g@@ ia: oesopha@@ geal dy@@ smo@@ tility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic dru@@ g use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic dru@@ gs should be used cauti@@ ously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumon@@ ia.
Phenylketonur@@ ic@@ s:
ABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain asparta@@ me, a sour@@ ce of phenyl@@ alan@@ ine which may be harm@@ ful for people with phenyl@@ ketonur@@ ia.
Hyper@@ sensitiv@@ ity: as with other medic@@ ations hypersensitivity reac@@ tions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adren@@ ergic receptor antagonis@@ m, aripiprazole has the potential to enhan@@ ce the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
G@@ i@@ ven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with al@@ cohol or other CNS medicinal products with over@@ l@@ app@@ ing undesirable effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electroly@@ te i@@ mb@@ al@@ ance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY:
A ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ er, the H@@ 2 antagonist fa@@ motid@@ ine, reduc@@ es aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is de@@ emed not clinically relevan@@ t.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple path@@ ways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1@@ A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smok@@ ers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (@@ quinid@@ ine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax was unchange@@ d.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinid@@ ine occurs.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as flu@@ oxetin@@ e and par@@ oxetin@@ e, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (@@ ketoconaz@@ ol@@ e) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 6@@ 3% and 37@@ %, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43@@ %, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolis@@ ers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabol@@ iz@@ ers.
When consider@@ ing concomitant administration of ketoconaz@@ ole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should out@@ weig@@ h the potential risks to the patient@@ .
When concomitant administration of keto@@ con@@ oz@@ ole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as it@@ ra@@ conaz@@ ole and HIV prote@@ ase inhibitor@@ s, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor@@ , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When we@@ a@@ k inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e. g@@ ., di@@ l@@ tiazem or esc@@ italopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, mode@@ st increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expec@@ ted.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazep@@ ine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone.
Si@@ mi@@ lar@@ ly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means
49 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazep@@ ine co@@ -@@ administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be dou@@ b@@ led when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazep@@ ine.
J@@ oh@@ n@@ 's Wort@@ ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 induc@@ ers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal produc@@ ts:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of subst@@ rates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan@@ / 3-@@ meth@@ oxymorphin@@ an ratio@@ ), 2C9 (@@ war@@ farin), 2C19 (@@ om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole@@ ), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan@@ ).
Addi@@ tion@@ al@@ ly, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for alter@@ ing CYP1A@@ 2-@@ mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product inter@@ actions mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium@@ , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
An@@ imal studies could not exclu@@ de potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to no@@ tif@@ y their physician if they become pregnant or inten@@ d to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concern@@ s ra@@ ised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly ju@@ sti@@ f@@ ies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole was excreted in the mil@@ k of treated rats during lact@@ ation.
Patients should be advised not to breast fe@@ ed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performe@@ d.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be cau@@ tion@@ ed about oper@@ ating haz@@ ard@@ ous machines, including mo@@ tor v@@ eh@@ ic@@ les, until they are reas@@ on@@ ably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adver@@ se@@ ly.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following undesirable effects occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions (*@@ ):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following conven@@ tion: common (> 1/ 100 ,@@ < 1/10@@ ) and uncommon (> 1/@@ 1 ,@@ 000, < 1/100).
50 Cardiac disorders Uncommon: tachycardia@@ * Nervous Sy@@ stem disorders Common: extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, tre@@ mor@@ , dizziness, somnolence, sed@@ ation, headach@@ e Eye disorders Common: blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common: dyspep@@ sia, vomiting, nausea, constipation, saliv@@ ary hyper@@ sec@@ retion Vascular disorders Uncommon: orthostatic hypoten@@ sion* General disorders and administration site conditions Common: fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common: restlessness, insomn@@ ia, anxiety Uncommon: depres@@ sion*
Extrapyramid@@ al symptoms (EPS):
Schizophren@@ ia - in a long term 52-@@ week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patients had an over@@ all@@ -@@ lower incidence (2@@ 5.@@ 8%) of EPS including par@@ kinsonis@@ m, akathisia, dy@@ ston@@ ia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57@@ .@@ 3%).
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 19% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13@@ .1% for placebo-treated patients.
In another lon@@ g-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 1@@ 4.8@@ % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 1@@ 5.1@@ % for olanzap@@ in@@ e-treated patients.
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 2@@ 3.5% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 5@@ 3.@@ 3% for haloperidol@@ -treated patients.
In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS was 2@@ 6.@@ 6% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17@@ .6% for those treated with lithium@@ .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.@@ 7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12@@ .1% with aripiprazole and 3.@@ 2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.@@ 2% with aripiprazole and 3.@@ 0% with placebo.
Com@@ par@@ ison@@ s between aripiprazole and placebo in the propor@@ tions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differenc@@ es.

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and post-marketing experienc@@ e, accidental or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,@@ 260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoe@@ a.
In addition, reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (@@ up to 195 mg) in children have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should conc@@ ent@@ rate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate air@@ wa@@ y, oxy@@ gen@@ ation and ven@@ til@@ ation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product invol@@ ve@@ ment should be considered.
There@@ fore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continu@@ ous elec@@ tro@@ cardi@@ ograph@@ ic monitoring to detec@@ t possible arrhythmias@@ .
Following any con@@ fir@@ med or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, clo@@ se medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recover@@ s.
52 Ac@@ tiv@@ ated charcoal (@@ 50 g@@ ), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 4@@ 1% and AUC by about 5@@ 1@@ %, sugge@@ sting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of over@@ dose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treat@@ ing an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be use@@ ful in overdose management since aripiprazole is high@@ ly bound to plasma protein@@ s.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
It has been propo@@ sed that aripiprazol@@ e’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonis@@ m at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonis@@ m of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyper@@ activity and agon@@ ist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypo@@ activ@@ ity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D@@ 3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D@@ 4, serotonin 5HT2@@ c and 5HT7@@ , alpha-@@ 1 adren@@ ergic and his@@ tamine H@@ 1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin re@@ up@@ take site and no ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ able affinity for mus@@ car@@ in@@ ic receptors.
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin sub@@ types may expla@@ in some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole doses rang@@ ing from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-@@ ra@@ clo@@ pri@@ de, a D2@@ / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and, to the cau@@ date and p@@ uta@@ men detected by posit@@ ron e@@ mission tom@@ og@@ ra@@ phy@@ .
Further information on clinical trial@@ s:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,@@ 228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with posi@@ tive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continu@@ ation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment respon@@ se.
In a haloperidol@@ -controlled trial, the proportion of respon@@ der patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-@@ weeks was similar in both groups (@@ aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Ac@@ tu@@ al s@@ co@@ res in ra@@ ting scal@@ es used as secondary end@@ po@@ in@@ ts, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asber@@ g Depres@@ sion R@@ ating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol@@ .
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in rel@@ ap@@ se rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzap@@ ine-@@ controlled, double-blind, multi@@ -@@ national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary en@@ d-@@ point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.@@ 6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~@@ 8@@ 0.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18@@ , or 13% of evaluable patient@@ s), compared to olanzap@@ ine (N= 45@@ , or 3@@ 3% of evaluable patients).
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexib@@ le-@@ dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
These trials included patients with or without psychotic feat@@ u@@ res and with or without a rapid@@ -@@ cy@@ cling cour@@ se.
In one 3-week, fixed-@@ dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-@@ week, placebo@@ - and activ@@ e-@@ controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-@@ week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were par@@ tially non-@@ respon@@ sive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum level@@ s, the addition of aripiprazole as adj@@ unc@@ tive therapy resul@@ ted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate mono@@ therapy.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 7@@ 4-@@ week exten@@ sion, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stab@@ ili@@ z@@ ation phase prior to ran@@ do@@ mi@@ z@@ ation, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recur@@ ren@@ c@@ e, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet is bio@@ equ@@ iv@@ alent to aripiprazole table@@ ts, with a similar rate and extent of absorp@@ tion.
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablets may be used as an altern@@ ative to aripiprazole tablets.
Ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion:
Aripiprazole is well absor@@ be@@ d, with peak plasma concentrations occur@@ r@@ ing within 3-5 hours after dos@@ ing.
Aripiprazole undergo@@ es min@@ imal pre-@@ systemic metabolis@@ m.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet form@@ ulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high f@@ at me@@ al on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Dis@@ tribu@@ tion:
Aripiprazole is wide@@ ly distribu@@ ted throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extra@@ vascular distribu@@ tion.
At therapeutic concentr@@ ations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum protein@@ s, binding primarily to album@@ in.
Metabolis@@ m@@ :
Aripiprazole is exten@@ sively metabolised by the liver primarily by three bio@@ trans@@ formation pathwa@@ y@@ s: dehydrogen@@ ation, hydrox@@ yl@@ ation, and N-dealk@@ yl@@ ation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogen@@ ation and hydrox@@ ylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealk@@ ylation is cataly@@ sed by CYP3A@@ 4.
Aripiprazole is the predomin@@ ant medicinal product mo@@ iety in systemic circulation.
At ste@@ ady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, re@@ presents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plas@@ ma@@ .
Elimination:
The mean elimin@@ ation half-@@ li@@ ves for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 m@@ l/ min@@ / kg, which is primarily hep@@ ati@@ c.
Following a single oral dose of [@@ 14@@ C@@ ]@@ -@@ labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radio@@ activity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
L@@ ess than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
5@@ 4 Pharmacokineti@@ cs in special patient groups
Elderly:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and yo@@ unger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gen@@ der in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Rac@@ e:
Pop@@ ulation pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant rac@@ e-@@ related differences or effects from smo@@ king upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to yo@@ ung healthy subjec@@ ts.
Hep@@ atic Disease:
A single-@@ dose study in subjects with var@@ y@@ ing de@@ gre@@ es of liver cirrho@@ sis (Child-Pugh C@@ las@@ ses A, B, and C) did not reve@@ al a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with C@@ lass C liver cirrho@@ sis, which is insufficient to dra@@ w conc@@ lu@@ sions on their metabolic cap@@ ac@@ ity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-@@ clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmac@@ olog@@ y, repe@@ at-@@ dose toxicity, geno@@ toxicity, carcinogenic potenti@@ al, and toxicity to reproduc@@ tion.
Tox@@ ic@@ olog@@ ically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were suff@@ ici@@ ently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposu@@ re, indicating that these effects were limit@@ ed or of no relev@@ ance to clinical use.
These include@@ d: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (@@ l@@ ipofusc@@ in pig@@ ment accumul@@ ation and/ or par@@ enchy@@ mal cell loss@@ ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human do@@ se) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and com@@ bin@@ ed adrenocortical adenom@@ as@@ / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human do@@ se@@ ).
The highest n@@ on@@ tumor@@ igen@@ ic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional fin@@ ding was ch@@ olelithiasis as a con@@ sequ@@ ence of precip@@ it@@ ation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m@@ 2).
However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose propo@@ sed, 30 mg per da@@ y, were no more than 6% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39@@ -@@ week study and are well below (6%) their limit@@ s of in vitro solu@@ bil@@ ity.
Based on results of a full range of standard geno@@ toxicity te@@ st@@ s, aripiprazole was considered non-@@ geno@@ toxic@@ .
Aripiprazole did not impa@@ ir fer@@ tility in reproductive toxicity studies.
D@@ ev@@ e@@ lo@@ p@@ mental toxicity, including dose-dependent dela@@ y@@ ed foetal ossification and possible ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects, were observed in rats at doses resulting in sub@@ therapeutic exposures (@@ based on AUC) and in ra@@ bb@@ its at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Matern@@ al toxicity occurred at doses similar to those e@@ lic@@ it@@ ing developmental toxic@@ ity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophren@@ ia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predomin@@ antly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day.
En@@ han@@ ced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episode@@ s:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to me@@ als as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Rec@@ ur@@ rence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ments of daily do@@ sa@@ ge, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical stat@@ us.
The orodispersible tablet should be plac@@ ed in the mouth on the tongue, where it will rapid@@ ly di@@ sper@@ se in saliv@@ a.
It can be taken with or without liqu@@ id@@ .
Re@@ mo@@ v@@ al of the int@@ act orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficul@@ t.
S@@ ince the orodispersible tablet is fra@@ gi@@ le, it should be taken immediately on open@@ ing the blister.
Alternatively, di@@ sper@@ se the tablet in water and drink the resulting su@@ spen@@ sion.
5@@ 8 The orodispersible tablets may be used as an altern@@ ative to ABILIFY tablets for patients who have difficulty to swal@@ low ABILIFY tablets (see also section 5.2).
Children and adolesc@@ ents: there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patients with severe hepatic impairment@@ , the data available are insufficient to establis@@ h recommend@@ ations.
In these patients dosing should be managed cauti@@ ously.
However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or ol@@ der has not been established.
O@@ wing to the greater sensitivity of this popul@@ ation, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors war@@ ran@@ t (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2).
Smoking stat@@ us: according to the metabolic pathwa@@ y of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smok@@ ers (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduc@@ ed.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 induc@@ ers with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increa@@ sed.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Dur@@ ing antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is in@@ her@@ ent in psychotic illnes@@ ses and mo@@ od disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or swit@@ ch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
C@@ lose supervision of high@@ -risk patients should accomp@@ any antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemi@@ ological study found that there was no increased risk of suicid@@ al@@ ity with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder@@ .
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (@@ history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduc@@ tion abnormaliti@@ es), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which w@@ ould predispose patients to hypotension (@@ de@@ hydration, hypo@@ vol@@ emi@@ a, and treatment with antihypertensive medic@@ ation@@ s) or hypertension, including accel@@ erated or malign@@ ant.
Con@@ duc@@ tion abnormaliti@@ es:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolong@@ ation.
59 T@@ ardi@@ ve Dyskinesi@@ a: in clinical trials of one ye@@ ar or less dur@@ ation, there were uncommon reports of treatment e@@ m@@ erg@@ ent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appe@@ ar in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptoms can temp@@ orally deter@@ i@@ or@@ ate or can even ar@@ ise after discontinuation of treatment.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NM@@ S):
NMS is a potentially fatal sy@@ mp@@ to@@ m comple@@ x associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
C@@ linical manifestations of NMS are hyper@@ pyrex@@ ia, muscle rigidi@@ ty, altered mental status and evidence of auton@@ o@@ mic in@@ stability (@@ irregular pul@@ se or blood pressure, tachycardia, di@@ ap@@ ho@@ re@@ sis and cardiac dy@@ s@@ rhythmi@@ a).
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosp@@ hokinase, myo@@ globinur@@ ia (@@ rhabdomyoly@@ sis@@ ), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosp@@ hokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessar@@ ily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develop@@ s signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high f@@ ever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Sei@@ zu@@ re: in clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizu@@ res.
El@@ derly patients with dementia-related psycho@@ sis:
Increased mortal@@ ity: in three placebo-controlled trials (n= 938@@ ; mean age:
8@@ 2.@@ 4 years; range:
5@@ 6-@@ 99 year@@ s) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheim@@ er@@ 's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5% compared to 1.@@ 7% in the placebo group.
Although the causes of deaths were var@@ ie@@ d, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death@@ ) or infec@@ ti@@ ous (e. g. pneumon@@ ia) in nat@@ ure.
C@@ erebrovascular adverse ev@@ ents: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack@@ ), including fataliti@@ es, were reported in patients (@@ mean age:
84 years; range:
78@@ -88 year@@ s).
Over@@ all, 1.@@ 3% of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.@@ 6% of placebo-treated patients in these trials.
This difference was not statistically signific@@ ant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-@@ dose trial, there was a significant dose response rel@@ ation@@ sh@@ ip for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psycho@@ sis.
Hyper@@ glycaemia and Diabetes Mell@@ it@@ us: hyperglycaemia, in some cases extre@@ me and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabete@@ s.
In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events (including diabete@@ s) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo.
Prec@@ ise risk estima@@ tes for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to al@@ low direc@@ t compar@@ ison@@ s.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (@@ such as poly@@ dip@@ sia, poly@@ uria, poly@@ pha@@ gia and weaknes@@ s) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is common@@ ly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co@@ - mor@@ bidi@@ ti@@ es, use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, po@@ or@@ ly managed life-@@ st@@ y@@ le, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY.
When se@@ en, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thy@@ ro@@ id disorder or p@@ itu@@ it@@ ary adenom@@ a.
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
60 Dyspha@@ g@@ ia: oesopha@@ geal dy@@ smo@@ tility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic dru@@ g use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic dru@@ gs should be used cauti@@ ously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumon@@ ia.
Phenylketonur@@ ic@@ s:
ABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain asparta@@ me, a sour@@ ce of phenyl@@ alan@@ ine which may be harm@@ ful for people with phenyl@@ ketonur@@ ia.
Hyper@@ sensitiv@@ ity: as with other medic@@ ations hypersensitivity reac@@ tions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adren@@ ergic receptor antagonis@@ m, aripiprazole has the potential to enhan@@ ce the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
G@@ i@@ ven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with al@@ cohol or other CNS medicinal products with over@@ l@@ app@@ ing undesirable effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electroly@@ te i@@ mb@@ al@@ ance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY:
A ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ er, the H@@ 2 antagonist fa@@ motid@@ ine, reduc@@ es aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is de@@ emed not clinically relevan@@ t.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple path@@ ways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1@@ A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smok@@ ers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (@@ quinid@@ ine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax was unchange@@ d.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinid@@ ine occurs.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as flu@@ oxetin@@ e and par@@ oxetin@@ e, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (@@ ketoconaz@@ ol@@ e) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 6@@ 3% and 37@@ %, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43@@ %, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolis@@ ers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabol@@ iz@@ ers.
When consider@@ ing concomitant administration of ketoconaz@@ ole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should out@@ weig@@ h the potential risks to the patient@@ .
When concomitant administration of keto@@ con@@ oz@@ ole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as it@@ ra@@ conaz@@ ole and HIV prote@@ ase inhibitor@@ s, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor@@ , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When we@@ a@@ k inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e. g@@ ., di@@ l@@ tiazem or esc@@ italopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, mode@@ st increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expec@@ ted.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazep@@ ine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone.
Si@@ mi@@ lar@@ ly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means
61 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazep@@ ine co@@ -@@ administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be dou@@ b@@ led when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazep@@ ine.
J@@ oh@@ n@@ 's Wort@@ ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 induc@@ ers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal produc@@ ts:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of subst@@ rates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan@@ / 3-@@ meth@@ oxymorphin@@ an ratio@@ ), 2C9 (@@ war@@ farin), 2C19 (@@ om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole@@ ), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan@@ ).
Addi@@ tion@@ al@@ ly, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for alter@@ ing CYP1A@@ 2-@@ mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product inter@@ actions mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium@@ , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
An@@ imal studies could not exclu@@ de potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to no@@ tif@@ y their physician if they become pregnant or inten@@ d to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concern@@ s ra@@ ised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly ju@@ sti@@ f@@ ies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole was excreted in the mil@@ k of treated rats during lact@@ ation.
Patients should be advised not to breast fe@@ ed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performe@@ d.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be cau@@ tion@@ ed about oper@@ ating haz@@ ard@@ ous machines, including mo@@ tor v@@ eh@@ ic@@ les, until they are reas@@ on@@ ably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adver@@ se@@ ly.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following undesirable effects occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions (*@@ ):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following conven@@ tion: common (> 1/ 100 ,@@ < 1/10@@ ) and uncommon (> 1/@@ 1 ,@@ 000, < 1/100).

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and post-marketing experienc@@ e, accidental or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,@@ 260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoe@@ a.
In addition, reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (@@ up to 195 mg) in children have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should conc@@ ent@@ rate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate air@@ wa@@ y, oxy@@ gen@@ ation and ven@@ til@@ ation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product invol@@ ve@@ ment should be considered.
There@@ fore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continu@@ ous elec@@ tro@@ cardi@@ ograph@@ ic monitoring to detec@@ t possible arrhythmias@@ .
Following any con@@ fir@@ med or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, clo@@ se medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recover@@ s.
64 Ac@@ tiv@@ ated charcoal (@@ 50 g@@ ), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 4@@ 1% and AUC by about 5@@ 1@@ %, sugge@@ sting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of over@@ dose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treat@@ ing an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be use@@ ful in overdose management since aripiprazole is high@@ ly bound to plasma protein@@ s.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
It has been propo@@ sed that aripiprazol@@ e’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonis@@ m at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonis@@ m of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyper@@ activity and agon@@ ist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypo@@ activ@@ ity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D@@ 3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D@@ 4, serotonin 5HT2@@ c and 5HT7@@ , alpha-@@ 1 adren@@ ergic and his@@ tamine H@@ 1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin re@@ up@@ take site and no ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ able affinity for mus@@ car@@ in@@ ic receptors.
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin sub@@ types may expla@@ in some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole doses rang@@ ing from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-@@ ra@@ clo@@ pri@@ de, a D2@@ / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and, to the cau@@ date and p@@ uta@@ men detected by posit@@ ron e@@ mission tom@@ og@@ ra@@ phy@@ .
Further information on clinical trial@@ s:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,@@ 228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with posi@@ tive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continu@@ ation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment respon@@ se.
In a haloperidol@@ -controlled trial, the proportion of respon@@ der patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-@@ weeks was similar in both groups (@@ aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Ac@@ tu@@ al s@@ co@@ res in ra@@ ting scal@@ es used as secondary end@@ po@@ in@@ ts, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asber@@ g Depres@@ sion R@@ ating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol@@ .
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in rel@@ ap@@ se rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzap@@ ine-@@ controlled, double-blind, multi@@ -@@ national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary en@@ d-@@ point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.@@ 6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~@@ 8@@ 0.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18@@ , or 13% of evaluable patient@@ s), compared to olanzap@@ ine (N= 45@@ , or 3@@ 3% of evaluable patients).
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexib@@ le-@@ dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
These trials included patients with or without psychotic feat@@ u@@ res and with or without a rapid@@ -@@ cy@@ cling cour@@ se.
In one 3-week, fixed-@@ dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-@@ week, placebo@@ - and activ@@ e-@@ controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-@@ week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were par@@ tially non-@@ respon@@ sive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum level@@ s, the addition of aripiprazole as adj@@ unc@@ tive therapy resul@@ ted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate mono@@ therapy.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 7@@ 4-@@ week exten@@ sion, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stab@@ ili@@ z@@ ation phase prior to ran@@ do@@ mi@@ z@@ ation, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recur@@ ren@@ c@@ e, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet is bio@@ equ@@ iv@@ alent to aripiprazole table@@ ts, with a similar rate and extent of absorp@@ tion.
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablets may be used as an altern@@ ative to aripiprazole tablets.
Ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion:
Aripiprazole is well absor@@ be@@ d, with peak plasma concentrations occur@@ r@@ ing within 3-5 hours after dos@@ ing.
Aripiprazole undergo@@ es min@@ imal pre-@@ systemic metabolis@@ m.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet form@@ ulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high f@@ at me@@ al on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Dis@@ tribu@@ tion:
Aripiprazole is wide@@ ly distribu@@ ted throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extra@@ vascular distribu@@ tion.
At therapeutic concentr@@ ations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum protein@@ s, binding primarily to album@@ in.
Metabolis@@ m@@ :
Aripiprazole is exten@@ sively metabolised by the liver primarily by three bio@@ trans@@ formation pathwa@@ y@@ s: dehydrogen@@ ation, hydrox@@ yl@@ ation, and N-dealk@@ yl@@ ation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogen@@ ation and hydrox@@ ylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealk@@ ylation is cataly@@ sed by CYP3A@@ 4.
Aripiprazole is the predomin@@ ant medicinal product mo@@ iety in systemic circulation.
At ste@@ ady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, re@@ presents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plas@@ ma@@ .
Elimination:
The mean elimin@@ ation half-@@ li@@ ves for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 m@@ l/ min@@ / kg, which is primarily hep@@ ati@@ c.
Following a single oral dose of [@@ 14@@ C@@ ]@@ -@@ labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radio@@ activity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
L@@ ess than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
66 Pharmacokineti@@ cs in special patient groups
Elderly:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and yo@@ unger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gen@@ der in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Rac@@ e:
Pop@@ ulation pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant rac@@ e-@@ related differences or effects from smo@@ king upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to yo@@ ung healthy subjec@@ ts.
Hep@@ atic Disease:
A single-@@ dose study in subjects with var@@ y@@ ing de@@ gre@@ es of liver cirrho@@ sis (Child-Pugh C@@ las@@ ses A, B, and C) did not reve@@ al a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with C@@ lass C liver cirrho@@ sis, which is insufficient to dra@@ w conc@@ lu@@ sions on their metabolic cap@@ ac@@ ity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-@@ clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmac@@ olog@@ y, repe@@ at-@@ dose toxicity, geno@@ toxicity, carcinogenic potenti@@ al, and toxicity to reproduc@@ tion.
Tox@@ ic@@ olog@@ ically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were suff@@ ici@@ ently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposu@@ re, indicating that these effects were limit@@ ed or of no relev@@ ance to clinical use.
These include@@ d: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (@@ l@@ ipofusc@@ in pig@@ ment accumul@@ ation and/ or par@@ enchy@@ mal cell loss@@ ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human do@@ se) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and com@@ bin@@ ed adrenocortical adenom@@ as@@ / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human do@@ se@@ ).
The highest n@@ on@@ tumor@@ igen@@ ic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional fin@@ ding was ch@@ olelithiasis as a con@@ sequ@@ ence of precip@@ it@@ ation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m@@ 2).
However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose propo@@ sed, 30 mg per da@@ y, were no more than 6% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39@@ -@@ week study and are well below (6%) their limit@@ s of in vitro solu@@ bil@@ ity.
Based on results of a full range of standard geno@@ toxicity te@@ st@@ s, aripiprazole was considered non-@@ geno@@ toxic@@ .
Aripiprazole did not impa@@ ir fer@@ tility in reproductive toxicity studies.
D@@ ev@@ e@@ lo@@ p@@ mental toxicity, including dose-dependent dela@@ y@@ ed foetal ossification and possible ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects, were observed in rats at doses resulting in sub@@ therapeutic exposures (@@ based on AUC) and in ra@@ bb@@ its at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Matern@@ al toxicity occurred at doses similar to those e@@ lic@@ it@@ ing developmental toxic@@ ity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophren@@ ia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predomin@@ antly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day.
En@@ han@@ ced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episode@@ s:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to me@@ als as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Rec@@ ur@@ rence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ments of daily do@@ sa@@ ge, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical stat@@ us.
The orodispersible tablet should be plac@@ ed in the mouth on the tongue, where it will rapid@@ ly di@@ sper@@ se in saliv@@ a.
It can be taken with or without liqu@@ id@@ .
Re@@ mo@@ v@@ al of the int@@ act orodispersible tablet from the mouth is difficul@@ t.
S@@ ince the orodispersible tablet is fra@@ gi@@ le, it should be taken immediately on open@@ ing the blister.
Alternatively, di@@ sper@@ se the tablet in water and drink the resulting su@@ spen@@ sion.
70 The orodispersible tablets may be used as an altern@@ ative to ABILIFY tablets for patients who have difficulty to swal@@ low ABILIFY tablets (see also section 5.2).
Children and adolesc@@ ents: there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patients with severe hepatic impairment@@ , the data available are insufficient to establis@@ h recommend@@ ations.
In these patients dosing should be managed cauti@@ ously.
However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or ol@@ der has not been established.
O@@ wing to the greater sensitivity of this popul@@ ation, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors war@@ ran@@ t (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2).
Smoking stat@@ us: according to the metabolic pathwa@@ y of aripiprazole no dosage adjustment is required for smok@@ ers (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduc@@ ed.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 induc@@ ers with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increa@@ sed.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Dur@@ ing antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is in@@ her@@ ent in psychotic illnes@@ ses and mo@@ od disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or swit@@ ch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
C@@ lose supervision of high@@ -risk patients should accomp@@ any antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemi@@ ological study found that there was no increased risk of suicid@@ al@@ ity with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder@@ .
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (@@ history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduc@@ tion abnormaliti@@ es), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which w@@ ould predispose patients to hypotension (@@ de@@ hydration, hypo@@ vol@@ emi@@ a, and treatment with antihypertensive medic@@ ation@@ s) or hypertension, including accel@@ erated or malign@@ ant.
Con@@ duc@@ tion abnormaliti@@ es:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolong@@ ation.
71 T@@ ardi@@ ve Dyskinesi@@ a: in clinical trials of one ye@@ ar or less dur@@ ation, there were uncommon reports of treatment e@@ m@@ erg@@ ent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appe@@ ar in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptoms can temp@@ orally deter@@ i@@ or@@ ate or can even ar@@ ise after discontinuation of treatment.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NM@@ S):
NMS is a potentially fatal sy@@ mp@@ to@@ m comple@@ x associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
C@@ linical manifestations of NMS are hyper@@ pyrex@@ ia, muscle rigidi@@ ty, altered mental status and evidence of auton@@ o@@ mic in@@ stability (@@ irregular pul@@ se or blood pressure, tachycardia, di@@ ap@@ ho@@ re@@ sis and cardiac dy@@ s@@ rhythmi@@ a).
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosp@@ hokinase, myo@@ globinur@@ ia (@@ rhabdomyoly@@ sis@@ ), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosp@@ hokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessar@@ ily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develop@@ s signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high f@@ ever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Sei@@ zu@@ re: in clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizu@@ res.
El@@ derly patients with dementia-related psycho@@ sis:
Increased mortal@@ ity: in three placebo-controlled trials (n= 938@@ ; mean age:
8@@ 2.@@ 4 years; range:
5@@ 6-@@ 99 year@@ s) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheim@@ er@@ 's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5% compared to 1.@@ 7% in the placebo group.
Although the causes of deaths were var@@ ie@@ d, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death@@ ) or infec@@ ti@@ ous (e. g. pneumon@@ ia) in nat@@ ure.
C@@ erebrovascular adverse ev@@ ents: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack@@ ), including fataliti@@ es, were reported in patients (@@ mean age:
84 years; range:
78@@ -88 year@@ s).
Over@@ all, 1.@@ 3% of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.@@ 6% of placebo-treated patients in these trials.
This difference was not statistically signific@@ ant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-@@ dose trial, there was a significant dose response rel@@ ation@@ sh@@ ip for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psycho@@ sis.
Hyper@@ glycaemia and Diabetes Mell@@ it@@ us: hyperglycaemia, in some cases extre@@ me and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabete@@ s.
In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events (including diabete@@ s) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo.
Prec@@ ise risk estima@@ tes for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to al@@ low direc@@ t compar@@ ison@@ s.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (@@ such as poly@@ dip@@ sia, poly@@ uria, poly@@ pha@@ gia and weaknes@@ s) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is common@@ ly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co@@ - mor@@ bidi@@ ti@@ es, use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, po@@ or@@ ly managed life-@@ st@@ y@@ le, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY.
When se@@ en, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thy@@ ro@@ id disorder or p@@ itu@@ it@@ ary adenom@@ a.
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
72 Dyspha@@ g@@ ia: oesopha@@ geal dy@@ smo@@ tility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic dru@@ g use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic dru@@ gs should be used cauti@@ ously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumon@@ ia.
Phenylketonur@@ ic@@ s:
ABILIFY orodispersible tablets contain asparta@@ me, a sour@@ ce of phenyl@@ alan@@ ine which may be harm@@ ful for people with phenyl@@ ketonur@@ ia.
Hyper@@ sensitiv@@ ity: as with other medic@@ ations hypersensitivity reac@@ tions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adren@@ ergic receptor antagonis@@ m, aripiprazole has the potential to enhan@@ ce the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
G@@ i@@ ven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with al@@ cohol or other CNS medicinal products with over@@ l@@ app@@ ing undesirable effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electroly@@ te i@@ mb@@ al@@ ance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY:
A ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ er, the H@@ 2 antagonist fa@@ motid@@ ine, reduc@@ es aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is de@@ emed not clinically relevan@@ t.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple path@@ ways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1@@ A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smok@@ ers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (@@ quinid@@ ine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax was unchange@@ d.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinid@@ ine occurs.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as flu@@ oxetin@@ e and par@@ oxetin@@ e, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (@@ ketoconaz@@ ol@@ e) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 6@@ 3% and 37@@ %, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43@@ %, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolis@@ ers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabol@@ iz@@ ers.
When consider@@ ing concomitant administration of ketoconaz@@ ole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should out@@ weig@@ h the potential risks to the patient@@ .
When concomitant administration of keto@@ con@@ oz@@ ole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as it@@ ra@@ conaz@@ ole and HIV prote@@ ase inhibitor@@ s, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor@@ , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When we@@ a@@ k inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e. g@@ ., di@@ l@@ tiazem or esc@@ italopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, mode@@ st increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expec@@ ted.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazep@@ ine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone.
Si@@ mi@@ lar@@ ly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means
7@@ 3 of Cmax and AUC after carbamazep@@ ine co@@ -@@ administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be dou@@ b@@ led when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazep@@ ine.
J@@ oh@@ n@@ 's Wort@@ ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 induc@@ ers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal produc@@ ts:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of subst@@ rates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan@@ / 3-@@ meth@@ oxymorphin@@ an ratio@@ ), 2C9 (@@ war@@ farin), 2C19 (@@ om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole@@ ), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan@@ ).
Addi@@ tion@@ al@@ ly, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for alter@@ ing CYP1A@@ 2-@@ mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product inter@@ actions mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium@@ , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
An@@ imal studies could not exclu@@ de potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to no@@ tif@@ y their physician if they become pregnant or inten@@ d to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concern@@ s ra@@ ised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly ju@@ sti@@ f@@ ies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole was excreted in the mil@@ k of treated rats during lact@@ ation.
Patients should be advised not to breast fe@@ ed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performe@@ d.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be cau@@ tion@@ ed about oper@@ ating haz@@ ard@@ ous machines, including mo@@ tor v@@ eh@@ ic@@ les, until they are reas@@ on@@ ably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adver@@ se@@ ly.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following undesirable effects occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions (*@@ ):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following conven@@ tion: common (> 1/ 100 ,@@ < 1/10@@ ) and uncommon (> 1/@@ 1 ,@@ 000, < 1/100).
74 Cardiac disorders Uncommon: tachycardia@@ * Nervous Sy@@ stem disorders Common: extrapyramidal disorder, akathisia, tre@@ mor@@ , dizziness, somnolence, sed@@ ation, headach@@ e Eye disorders Common: blurred vision Gastrointestinal disorders Common: dyspep@@ sia, vomiting, nausea, constipation, saliv@@ ary hyper@@ sec@@ retion Vascular disorders Uncommon: orthostatic hypoten@@ sion* General disorders and administration site conditions Common: fatigue Psychiatric disorders Common: restlessness, insomn@@ ia, anxiety Uncommon: depres@@ sion*
Extrapyramid@@ al symptoms (EPS):
Schizophren@@ ia - in a long term 52-@@ week controlled trial, aripiprazole-treated patients had an over@@ all@@ -@@ lower incidence (2@@ 5.@@ 8%) of EPS including par@@ kinsonis@@ m, akathisia, dy@@ ston@@ ia and dyskinesia compared with those treated with haloperidol (57@@ .@@ 3%).
In a long term 26-week placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 19% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 13@@ .1% for placebo-treated patients.
In another lon@@ g-term 26-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 1@@ 4.8@@ % for aripiprazole-treated patients and 1@@ 5.1@@ % for olanzap@@ in@@ e-treated patients.
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder - in a 12-week controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 2@@ 3.5% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 5@@ 3.@@ 3% for haloperidol@@ -treated patients.
In another 12-week trial, the incidence of EPS was 2@@ 6.@@ 6% for patients treated with aripiprazole and 17@@ .6% for those treated with lithium@@ .
In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.@@ 7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12@@ .1% with aripiprazole and 3.@@ 2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.@@ 2% with aripiprazole and 3.@@ 0% with placebo.
Com@@ par@@ ison@@ s between aripiprazole and placebo in the propor@@ tions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differenc@@ es.
E@@ lev@@ ations of CPK (C@@ reatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomati@@ c, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.@@ 0% of patients who received placebo.
Other find@@ ing@@ s:
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neur@@ oleptic malignant syn@@ dro@@ me, tardive dyskinesi@@ a, seizure, cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demen@@ ted patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and post-marketing experienc@@ e, accidental or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,@@ 260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoe@@ a.
In addition, reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (@@ up to 195 mg) in children have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should conc@@ ent@@ rate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate air@@ wa@@ y, oxy@@ gen@@ ation and ven@@ til@@ ation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product invol@@ ve@@ ment should be considered.
There@@ fore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continu@@ ous elec@@ tro@@ cardi@@ ograph@@ ic monitoring to detec@@ t possible arrhythmias@@ .
Following any con@@ fir@@ med or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, clo@@ se medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recover@@ s.
7@@ 6 Ac@@ tiv@@ ated charcoal (@@ 50 g@@ ), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 4@@ 1% and AUC by about 5@@ 1@@ %, sugge@@ sting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of over@@ dose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treat@@ ing an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be use@@ ful in overdose management since aripiprazole is high@@ ly bound to plasma protein@@ s.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
It has been propo@@ sed that aripiprazol@@ e’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonis@@ m at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonis@@ m of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyper@@ activity and agon@@ ist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypo@@ activ@@ ity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D@@ 3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D@@ 4, serotonin 5HT2@@ c and 5HT7@@ , alpha-@@ 1 adren@@ ergic and his@@ tamine H@@ 1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin re@@ up@@ take site and no ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ able affinity for mus@@ car@@ in@@ ic receptors.
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin sub@@ types may expla@@ in some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole doses rang@@ ing from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-@@ ra@@ clo@@ pri@@ de, a D2@@ / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and, to the cau@@ date and p@@ uta@@ men detected by posit@@ ron e@@ mission tom@@ og@@ ra@@ phy@@ .
Further information on clinical trial@@ s:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,@@ 228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with posi@@ tive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continu@@ ation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment respon@@ se.
In a haloperidol@@ -controlled trial, the proportion of respon@@ der patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-@@ weeks was similar in both groups (@@ aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Ac@@ tu@@ al s@@ co@@ res in ra@@ ting scal@@ es used as secondary end@@ po@@ in@@ ts, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asber@@ g Depres@@ sion R@@ ating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol@@ .
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in rel@@ ap@@ se rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzap@@ ine-@@ controlled, double-blind, multi@@ -@@ national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary en@@ d-@@ point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.@@ 6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~@@ 8@@ 0.5 kg) on aripiprazole (N= 18@@ , or 13% of evaluable patient@@ s), compared to olanzap@@ ine (N= 45@@ , or 3@@ 3% of evaluable patients).
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexib@@ le-@@ dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
These trials included patients with or without psychotic feat@@ u@@ res and with or without a rapid@@ -@@ cy@@ cling cour@@ se.
In one 3-week, fixed-@@ dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-@@ week, placebo@@ - and activ@@ e-@@ controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-@@ week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were par@@ tially non-@@ respon@@ sive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum level@@ s, the addition of aripiprazole as adj@@ unc@@ tive therapy resul@@ ted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate mono@@ therapy.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 7@@ 4-@@ week exten@@ sion, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stab@@ ili@@ z@@ ation phase prior to ran@@ do@@ mi@@ z@@ ation, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recur@@ ren@@ c@@ e, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablet is bio@@ equ@@ iv@@ alent to aripiprazole table@@ ts, with a similar rate and extent of absorp@@ tion.
Aripiprazole orodispersible tablets may be used as an altern@@ ative to aripiprazole tablets.
Ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion:
Aripiprazole is well absor@@ be@@ d, with peak plasma concentrations occur@@ r@@ ing within 3-5 hours after dos@@ ing.
Aripiprazole undergo@@ es min@@ imal pre-@@ systemic metabolis@@ m.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet form@@ ulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high f@@ at me@@ al on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Dis@@ tribu@@ tion:
Aripiprazole is wide@@ ly distribu@@ ted throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extra@@ vascular distribu@@ tion.
At therapeutic concentr@@ ations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum protein@@ s, binding primarily to album@@ in.
Metabolis@@ m@@ :
Aripiprazole is exten@@ sively metabolised by the liver primarily by three bio@@ trans@@ formation pathwa@@ y@@ s: dehydrogen@@ ation, hydrox@@ yl@@ ation, and N-dealk@@ yl@@ ation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogen@@ ation and hydrox@@ ylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealk@@ ylation is cataly@@ sed by CYP3A@@ 4.
Aripiprazole is the predomin@@ ant medicinal product mo@@ iety in systemic circulation.
At ste@@ ady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, re@@ presents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plas@@ ma@@ .
Elimination:
The mean elimin@@ ation half-@@ li@@ ves for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 m@@ l/ min@@ / kg, which is primarily hep@@ ati@@ c.
Following a single oral dose of [@@ 14@@ C@@ ]@@ -@@ labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radio@@ activity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
L@@ ess than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
78 Pharmacokineti@@ cs in special patient groups
Elderly:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and yo@@ unger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gen@@ der in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Rac@@ e:
Pop@@ ulation pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant rac@@ e-@@ related differences or effects from smo@@ king upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to yo@@ ung healthy subjec@@ ts.
Hep@@ atic Disease:
A single-@@ dose study in subjects with var@@ y@@ ing de@@ gre@@ es of liver cirrho@@ sis (Child-Pugh C@@ las@@ ses A, B, and C) did not reve@@ al a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with C@@ lass C liver cirrho@@ sis, which is insufficient to dra@@ w conc@@ lu@@ sions on their metabolic cap@@ ac@@ ity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-@@ clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmac@@ olog@@ y, repe@@ at-@@ dose toxicity, geno@@ toxicity, carcinogenic potenti@@ al, and toxicity to reproduc@@ tion.
Tox@@ ic@@ olog@@ ically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were suff@@ ici@@ ently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposu@@ re, indicating that these effects were limit@@ ed or of no relev@@ ance to clinical use.
These include@@ d: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (@@ l@@ ipofusc@@ in pig@@ ment accumul@@ ation and/ or par@@ enchy@@ mal cell loss@@ ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human do@@ se) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and com@@ bin@@ ed adrenocortical adenom@@ as@@ / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human do@@ se@@ ).
The highest n@@ on@@ tumor@@ igen@@ ic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional fin@@ ding was ch@@ olelithiasis as a con@@ sequ@@ ence of precip@@ it@@ ation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m@@ 2).
However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose propo@@ sed, 30 mg per da@@ y, were no more than 6% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39@@ -@@ week study and are well below (6%) their limit@@ s of in vitro solu@@ bil@@ ity.
Based on results of a full range of standard geno@@ toxicity te@@ st@@ s, aripiprazole was considered non-@@ geno@@ toxic@@ .
Aripiprazole did not impa@@ ir fer@@ tility in reproductive toxicity studies.
D@@ ev@@ e@@ lo@@ p@@ mental toxicity, including dose-dependent dela@@ y@@ ed foetal ossification and possible ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects, were observed in rats at doses resulting in sub@@ therapeutic exposures (@@ based on AUC) and in ra@@ bb@@ its at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Matern@@ al toxicity occurred at doses similar to those e@@ lic@@ it@@ ing developmental toxic@@ ity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of schizophren@@ ia.
ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who experienced predomin@@ antly manic episodes and whose manic episodes responded to aripiprazole treatment (see section 5.1).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Oral use.
ABILIFY oral solution may be used as an altern@@ ative to ABILIFY tablets for patients who have difficulty swallowing ABILIFY tablets (see section 5.2).
Schizophrenia:
The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg/ day (i. e.
10 or 15 ml solu@@ tion@@ / da@@ y) with a maintenance dose of 15 mg/ day administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to meals.
A calibrated me@@ as@@ ur@@ ing c@@ up and a 2 ml calibrated dro@@ pp@@ er are included in the car@@ ton.
ABILIFY is effective in a dose range of 10 to 30 mg/ day (i. e.
10 to 30 ml solu@@ tion@@ / da@@ y).
En@@ han@@ ced efficacy at doses higher than a daily dose of 15 mg has not been demonstrated although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose.
The maximum daily dose should not exceed 30 mg.
Manic episode@@ s:
15 ml solu@@ tion@@ / da@@ y) administered on a once-a-day schedule without regard to me@@ als as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).
Some patients may benefit from a higher dose.
30 ml solu@@ tion@@ / da@@ y).
Rec@@ ur@@ rence prevention of manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
8@@ 2 For preventing recurrence of manic episodes in patients who have been receiving aripiprazole, continue therapy at the same dose.
Ad@@ j@@ ust@@ ments of daily do@@ sa@@ ge, including dose reduction should be considered on the basis of clinical stat@@ us.
Children and adolesc@@ ents: there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patients with severe hepatic impairment@@ , the data available are insufficient to establis@@ h recommend@@ ations.
In these patients dosing should be managed cauti@@ ously.
However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder in patients 65 years of age or ol@@ der has not been established.
O@@ wing to the greater sensitivity of this popul@@ ation, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors war@@ ran@@ t (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Smoking stat@@ us: according to the metabolic pathwa@@ y of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smok@@ ers (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduc@@ ed.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 induc@@ ers with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increa@@ sed.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Dur@@ ing antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is in@@ her@@ ent in psychotic illnes@@ ses and mo@@ od disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or swit@@ ch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
C@@ lose supervision of high@@ -risk patients should accomp@@ any antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemi@@ ological study found that there was no increased risk of suicid@@ al@@ ity with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder@@ .
Cardiovascular disorders:
Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (@@ history of myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, or conduc@@ tion abnormaliti@@ es), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which w@@ ould predispose patients to hypotension (@@ de@@ hydration, hypo@@ vol@@ emi@@ a, and treatment with antihypertensive medic@@ ation@@ s) or hypertension, including accel@@ erated or malign@@ ant.
Con@@ duc@@ tion abnormaliti@@ es:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolong@@ ation.
83 T@@ ardi@@ ve dyskinesi@@ a: in clinical trials of one ye@@ ar or less dur@@ ation, there were uncommon reports of treatment e@@ m@@ erg@@ ent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appe@@ ar in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptoms can temp@@ orally deter@@ i@@ or@@ ate or can even ar@@ ise after discontinuation of treatment.
Neuroleptic malignant syn@@ dro@@ me (NM@@ S):
NMS is a potentially fatal sy@@ mp@@ to@@ m comple@@ x associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
C@@ linical manifestations of NMS are hyper@@ pyrex@@ ia, muscle rigidi@@ ty, altered mental status and evidence of auton@@ o@@ mic in@@ stability (@@ irregular pul@@ se or blood pressure, tachycardia, di@@ ap@@ ho@@ re@@ sis and cardiac dy@@ s@@ rhythmi@@ a).
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosp@@ hokinase, myo@@ globinur@@ ia (@@ rhabdomyoly@@ sis@@ ), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosp@@ hokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessar@@ ily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develop@@ s signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high f@@ ever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Sei@@ zu@@ re: in clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizu@@ res.
El@@ derly patients with dementia-related psycho@@ sis:
Increased mortal@@ ity: in three placebo-controlled trials (n= 938@@ ; mean age:
8@@ 2.@@ 4 years; range:
5@@ 6-@@ 99 year@@ s) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheim@@ er@@ 's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5% compared to 1.@@ 7% in the placebo group.
Although the causes of deaths were var@@ ie@@ d, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death@@ ) or infec@@ ti@@ ous (e. g. pneumon@@ ia) in nat@@ ure.
C@@ erebrovascular adverse ev@@ ents: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack@@ ), including fataliti@@ es, were reported in patients (@@ mean age:
84 years; range:
78@@ -88 year@@ s).
Over@@ all, 1.@@ 3% of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.@@ 6% of placebo-treated patients in these trials.
This difference was not statistically signific@@ ant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-@@ dose trial, there was a significant dose response rel@@ ation@@ sh@@ ip for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psycho@@ sis.
Hyper@@ glycaemia and diabetes mell@@ it@@ us: hyperglycaemia, in some cases extre@@ me and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabete@@ s.
In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events (including diabete@@ s) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo.
Prec@@ ise risk estima@@ tes for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to al@@ low direc@@ t compar@@ ison@@ s.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (@@ such as poly@@ dip@@ sia, poly@@ uria, poly@@ pha@@ gia and weaknes@@ s) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
Weight gain: weight gain is common@@ ly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co@@ - mor@@ bidi@@ ti@@ es, use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, po@@ or@@ ly managed life-@@ st@@ y@@ le, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY.
When se@@ en, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thy@@ ro@@ id disorder or p@@ itu@@ it@@ ary adenom@@ a.
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
84 Dyspha@@ g@@ ia: oesopha@@ geal dy@@ smo@@ tility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic dru@@ g use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic dru@@ gs should be used cauti@@ ously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumon@@ ia.
In@@ toler@@ anc@@ e:
The oral solution contains fru@@ c@@ to@@ se.
Patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance should not take this medicinal produc@@ t.
The oral solution contains me@@ thy@@ l para@@ hydroxybenzo@@ ate and propyl para@@ hydroxybenzo@@ ate which may cause allergic reactions (@@ possibly dela@@ ye@@ d).
The oral solution contains su@@ cro@@ se.
Patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance, gluco@@ se-@@ g@@ alac@@ tose mal@@ absorption or su@@ cra@@ se-@@ is@@ om@@ al@@ ta@@ se insufficiency should not take the oral solution.
Hyper@@ sensitiv@@ ity: as with other medic@@ ations hypersensitivity reac@@ tions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adren@@ ergic receptor antagonis@@ m, aripiprazole has the potential to enhan@@ ce the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
G@@ i@@ ven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with al@@ cohol or other CNS medicinal products with over@@ l@@ app@@ ing undesirable effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electroly@@ te i@@ mb@@ al@@ ance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY:
A ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ er, the H@@ 2 antagonist fa@@ motid@@ ine, reduc@@ es aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is de@@ emed not clinically relevan@@ t.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple path@@ ways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1@@ A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smok@@ ers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (@@ quinid@@ ine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax was unchange@@ d.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinid@@ ine occurs.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as flu@@ oxetin@@ e and par@@ oxetin@@ e, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (@@ ketoconaz@@ ol@@ e) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 6@@ 3% and 37@@ %, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43@@ %, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolis@@ ers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabol@@ iz@@ ers.
When consider@@ ing concomitant administration of ketoconaz@@ ole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should out@@ weig@@ h the potential risks to the patient@@ .
When concomitant administration of keto@@ con@@ oz@@ ole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as it@@ ra@@ conaz@@ ole and HIV prote@@ ase inhibitor@@ s, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor@@ , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
85 When we@@ a@@ k inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e. g@@ ., di@@ l@@ tiazem or esc@@ italopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, mode@@ st increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expec@@ ted.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazep@@ ine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone.
Si@@ mi@@ lar@@ ly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazep@@ ine co@@ -@@ administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be dou@@ b@@ led when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazep@@ ine.
J@@ oh@@ n@@ 's Wort@@ ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 induc@@ ers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal produc@@ ts:
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of subst@@ rates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan@@ / 3-@@ meth@@ oxymorphin@@ an ratio@@ ), 2C9 (@@ war@@ farin), 2C19 (@@ om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole@@ ), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan@@ ).
Addi@@ tion@@ al@@ ly, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for alter@@ ing CYP1A@@ 2-@@ mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product inter@@ actions mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium@@ , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
An@@ imal studies could not exclu@@ de potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to no@@ tif@@ y their physician if they become pregnant or inten@@ d to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concern@@ s ra@@ ised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly ju@@ sti@@ f@@ ies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole was excreted in the mil@@ k of treated rats during lact@@ ation.
Patients should be advised not to breast fe@@ ed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performe@@ d.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be cau@@ tion@@ ed about oper@@ ating haz@@ ard@@ ous machines, including mo@@ tor v@@ eh@@ ic@@ les, until they are reas@@ on@@ ably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adver@@ se@@ ly.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following undesirable effects occurred more often (≥ 1/ 100) than placebo, or were identified as possibly medically relevant adverse reactions (*@@ ):
The frequency listed below is defined using the following conven@@ tion: common (> 1/ 100 ,@@ < 1/10@@ ) and uncommon (> 1/@@ 1 ,@@ 000, < 1/100).

In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.@@ 7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12@@ .1% with aripiprazole and 3.@@ 2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.@@ 2% with aripiprazole and 3.@@ 0% with placebo.
Com@@ par@@ ison@@ s between aripiprazole and placebo in the propor@@ tions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differenc@@ es.
E@@ lev@@ ations of CPK (C@@ reatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomati@@ c, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.@@ 0% of patients who received placebo.

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and post-marketing experienc@@ e, accidental or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,@@ 260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoe@@ a.
In addition, reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (@@ up to 195 mg) in children have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should conc@@ ent@@ rate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate air@@ wa@@ y, oxy@@ gen@@ ation and ven@@ til@@ ation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product invol@@ ve@@ ment should be considered.
There@@ fore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continu@@ ous elec@@ tro@@ cardi@@ ograph@@ ic monitoring to detec@@ t possible arrhythmias@@ .
Following any con@@ fir@@ med or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, clo@@ se medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recover@@ s.
88 Ac@@ tiv@@ ated charcoal (@@ 50 g@@ ), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 4@@ 1% and AUC by about 5@@ 1@@ %, sugge@@ sting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of over@@ dose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treat@@ ing an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be use@@ ful in overdose management since aripiprazole is high@@ ly bound to plasma protein@@ s.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
It has been propo@@ sed that aripiprazol@@ e’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonis@@ m at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonis@@ m of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyper@@ activity and agon@@ ist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypo@@ activ@@ ity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D@@ 3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D@@ 4, serotonin 5HT2@@ c and 5HT7@@ , alpha-@@ 1 adren@@ ergic and his@@ tamine H@@ 1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin re@@ up@@ take site and no ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ able affinity for mus@@ car@@ in@@ ic receptors.
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin sub@@ types may expla@@ in some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole doses rang@@ ing from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-@@ ra@@ clo@@ pri@@ de, a D2@@ / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and, to the cau@@ date and p@@ uta@@ men detected by posit@@ ron e@@ mission tom@@ og@@ ra@@ phy@@ .
Further information on clinical trial@@ s:
Schizophrenia:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,@@ 228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with posi@@ tive or negative symptoms, aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continu@@ ation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment respon@@ se.
In a haloperidol@@ -controlled trial, the proportion of respon@@ der patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-@@ weeks was similar in both groups (@@ aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on aripiprazole (43%) than for haloperidol (30%).
Ac@@ tu@@ al s@@ co@@ res in ra@@ ting scal@@ es used as secondary end@@ po@@ in@@ ts, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asber@@ g Depres@@ sion R@@ ating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol@@ .
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schizophrenia, aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in rel@@ ap@@ se rate, 34% in aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzap@@ ine-@@ controlled, double-blind, multi@@ -@@ national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary en@@ d-@@ point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.@@ 6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~@@ 8@@ 0.5 kg) on aripiprazole (@@ N = 18@@ , or 13% of evaluable patient@@ s), compared to olanzap@@ ine (@@ N = 45@@ , or 3@@ 3% of evaluable patients).
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder:
In two 3-week, flexib@@ le-@@ dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in
These trials included patients with or without psychotic feat@@ u@@ res and with or without a rapid@@ -@@ cy@@ cling cour@@ se.
In one 3-week, fixed-@@ dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-@@ week, placebo@@ - and activ@@ e-@@ controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-@@ week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were par@@ tially non-@@ respon@@ sive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum level@@ s, the addition of aripiprazole as adj@@ unc@@ tive therapy resul@@ ted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate mono@@ therapy.
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 7@@ 4-@@ week exten@@ sion, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stab@@ ili@@ z@@ ation phase prior to ran@@ do@@ mi@@ z@@ ation, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recur@@ ren@@ c@@ e, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion:
Aripiprazole is well absor@@ be@@ d, with peak plasma concentrations occur@@ r@@ ing within 3-5 hours after dos@@ ing.
Aripiprazole undergo@@ es min@@ imal pre-@@ systemic metabolis@@ m.
The absolute oral bioavailability of the tablet form@@ ulation is 87%.
There is no effect of a high f@@ at me@@ al on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Dis@@ tribu@@ tion:
Aripiprazole is wide@@ ly distribu@@ ted throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extra@@ vascular distribu@@ tion.
At therapeutic concentr@@ ations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum protein@@ s, binding primarily to album@@ in.
Metabolis@@ m@@ :
Aripiprazole is exten@@ sively metabolised by the liver primarily by three bio@@ trans@@ formation pathwa@@ y@@ s: dehydrogen@@ ation, hydrox@@ yl@@ ation, and N-dealk@@ yl@@ ation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogen@@ ation and hydrox@@ ylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealk@@ ylation is cataly@@ sed by CYP3A@@ 4.
Aripiprazole is the predomin@@ ant medicinal product mo@@ iety in systemic circulation.
At ste@@ ady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, re@@ presents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plas@@ ma@@ .
Elimination:
The mean elimin@@ ation half-@@ li@@ ves for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 m@@ l/ min@@ / kg, which is primarily hep@@ ati@@ c.
Following a single oral dose of [@@ 14@@ C@@ ]@@ -@@ labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radio@@ activity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
L@@ ess than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Aripiprazole is well absor@@ bed when administered orally as the solution.
At equ@@ iv@@ alent do@@ ses, the peak plasma concentrations of aripiprazole (@@ Cma@@ x@@ ) from the solution were somewhat higher but the systemic
90 exposure (AUC) was equ@@ iv@@ alent to tablets.
In a relative bioavailability study compar@@ ing the pharmacokinetics of 30 mg aripiprazole as the oral solution to 30 mg aripiprazole tablets in healthy subjects, the solution to the tablet ratio of geometric mean Cmax values was 12@@ 2% (@@ N = 30@@ ).
The sing@@ le@@ - dose pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole were lin@@ e@@ ar and dose-@@ propor@@ tion@@ al.
Pharmacokineti@@ cs in special patient groups
Elderly:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and yo@@ unger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gen@@ der in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Rac@@ e:
Pop@@ ulation pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant rac@@ e-@@ related differences or effects from smo@@ king upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to yo@@ ung healthy subjec@@ ts.
Hep@@ atic Disease:
A single-@@ dose study in subjects with var@@ y@@ ing de@@ gre@@ es of liver cirrho@@ sis (Child-Pugh C@@ las@@ ses A, B, and C) did not reve@@ al a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with C@@ lass C liver cirrho@@ sis, which is insufficient to dra@@ w conc@@ lu@@ sions on their metabolic cap@@ ac@@ ity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Non-@@ clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety pharmac@@ olog@@ y, repe@@ at-@@ dose toxicity, geno@@ toxicity, carcinogenic potenti@@ al, and toxicity to reproduc@@ tion.
Tox@@ ic@@ olog@@ ically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were suff@@ ici@@ ently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposu@@ re, indicating that these effects were limit@@ ed or of no relev@@ ance to clinical use.
These include@@ d: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (@@ l@@ ipofusc@@ in pig@@ ment accumul@@ ation and/ or par@@ enchy@@ mal cell loss@@ ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human do@@ se) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and com@@ bin@@ ed adrenocortical adenom@@ as@@ / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human do@@ se@@ ).
The highest n@@ on@@ tumor@@ igen@@ ic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional fin@@ ding was ch@@ olelithiasis as a con@@ sequ@@ ence of precip@@ it@@ ation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m@@ 2).
However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose propo@@ sed, 30 mg per da@@ y, were no more than 6% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39@@ -@@ week study and are well below (6%) their limit@@ s of in vitro solu@@ bil@@ ity.
Based on results of a full range of standard geno@@ toxicity te@@ st@@ s, aripiprazole was considered non-@@ geno@@ toxic@@ .
Aripiprazole did not impa@@ ir fer@@ tility in reproductive toxicity studies.
D@@ ev@@ e@@ lo@@ p@@ mental toxicity, including dose-dependent dela@@ y@@ ed foetal ossification and possible ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects, were
91 observed in rats at doses resulting in sub@@ therapeutic exposures (@@ based on AUC) and in ra@@ bb@@ its at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Matern@@ al toxicity occurred at doses similar to those e@@ lic@@ it@@ ing developmental toxic@@ ity.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
ABILIFY solution for injection is indicated for the rapid control of agit@@ ation and di@@ st@@ ur@@ bed behaviours in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder, when oral therapy is not appro@@ pri@@ a@@ te.
Treatment with aripiprazole solution for injection should be discontinued as soon as clinically appropriate and the use of oral aripiprazole should be initi@@ ated.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
For intramus@@ cular use.
T@@ o enhan@@ ce absorption and minimise variability, injection into the del@@ to@@ id or deep within the g@@ lu@@ te@@ us maxim@@ us muscle@@ , avo@@ iding a@@ di@@ po@@ se region@@ s, is recommended.
ABILIFY solution for injection should not be administered intravenously or subcutane@@ ously.
ABILIFY solution for injection is ready to use and inten@@ ded for short-term use only (see section 5.1).
The recommended initial dose for aripiprazole solution for injection is 9.@@ 75 mg (1.@@ 3 m@@ l), administered as a single intramus@@ cular injection.
The effective dose range of aripiprazole solution for injection is 5.@@ 25@@ -@@ 15 mg as a single injection.
A lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg (@@ 0.7 ml) may be giv@@ en, on the basis of individual clinical status, which should also include consideration of medicinal products al@@ ready administered either for maintenance or acute treatment (see section 4.5).
A secon@@ d injection may be administered 2 hours after the first injection, on the basis of individual clinical status and no more than three injections should be given in any 2@@ 4-@@ hour period.
The maximum daily dose of aripiprazole is 30 mg (including all form@@ ul@@ ations of aripiprazol@@ e).
If continued treatment is indicated with oral aripiprazole, see the S@@ um@@ m@@ ary of Produc@@ t Char@@ acter@@ istics for ABILIFY table@@ ts, ABILIFY orodispersible table@@ ts, or ABILIFY oral solution.
Children and adolesc@@ ents: there is no experience in children and adolescents under 18 years of age.
Patients with hepatic impairment: no dosage adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment.
In patients with severe hepatic impairment@@ , the data available are insufficient to
9@@ 4 establis@@ h recommend@@ ations.
In these patients dosing should be managed cauti@@ ously.
However, the maximum daily dose of 30 mg should be used with caution in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment: no dosage adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment.
Elderly: the effectiveness of ABILIFY solution for injection in patients who are 65 years of age or ol@@ der has not been established.
O@@ wing to the greater sensitivity of this popul@@ ation, a lower starting dose should be considered when clinical factors war@@ ran@@ t (see section 4.4).
Gender: no dosage adjustment is required for female patients as compared to male patients (see section 5.2).
Smoking stat@@ us: according to the metabolic pathwa@@ y of ABILIFY no dosage adjustment is required for smok@@ ers (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitors with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be reduc@@ ed.
When the CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is withdrawn from the combination therapy, aripiprazole dose should then be increased (see section 4.5).
When concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 induc@@ ers with aripiprazole occurs, the aripiprazole dose should be increa@@ sed.
When the CYP3A4 inducer is withdrawn from the combination therapy, the aripiprazole dose should then be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
The efficacy of aripiprazole solution for injection in patients with agit@@ ation and di@@ st@@ ur@@ bed behaviours has not been established related to conditions other than schizophrenia and manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder@@ .
S@@ im@@ ul@@ tane@@ ous administration of injectable antipsychotics and par@@ ent@@ eral benzo@@ dia@@ zep@@ ine may be associated with excessive sedation and car@@ dio@@ re@@ spira@@ tory depression.
If par@@ ent@@ eral benzo@@ dia@@ zep@@ ine therapy is de@@ emed necessary in addition to aripiprazole solution for injection, patients should be monitored for excessive sedation and for orthostatic hypotension (see section 4.5).
Patients receiving aripiprazole solution for injection should be observed for orthostatic hypoten@@ sion.
Blood pressure, pul@@ se, re@@ spira@@ tory rate and level of consciousness should be monitored regul@@ ar@@ ly.
The safety and efficacy of aripiprazole solution for injection has not been evaluated in patients with al@@ cohol or medicinal product intoxic@@ ation (@@ either with prescribed or il@@ lic@@ it medicinal produc@@ ts@@ ).
Dur@@ ing antipsychotic treatment, improvement in the patient's clinical condition may take several days to some weeks.
Patients should be closely monitored throughout this period.
The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is in@@ her@@ ent in psychotic illnes@@ ses and mo@@ od disorders and in some cases has been reported early after initiation or swit@@ ch of antipsychotic therapy, including treatment with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
C@@ lose supervision of high@@ -risk patients should accomp@@ any antipsychotic therapy.
Results of an epidemi@@ ological study found that there was no increased risk of suicid@@ al@@ ity with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics among patients with bipolar disorder@@ .
Cardiovascular disorders:
95 conduc@@ tion abnormaliti@@ es), cerebrovascular disease, conditions which w@@ ould predispose patients to hypotension (@@ de@@ hydration, hypo@@ vol@@ emi@@ a, and treatment with antihypertensive medic@@ ation@@ s) or hypertension, including accel@@ erated or malign@@ ant.
Con@@ duc@@ tion abnormaliti@@ es:
In clinical trials of aripiprazole, the incidence of QT prolongation was comparable to placebo.
As with other antipsychotics, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with a family history of QT prolong@@ ation.
T@@ ardi@@ ve Dyskinesi@@ a: in clinical trials of one ye@@ ar or less dur@@ ation, there were uncommon reports of treatment e@@ m@@ erg@@ ent dyskinesia during treatment with aripiprazole.
If signs and symptoms of tardive dyskinesia appe@@ ar in a patient on ABILIFY, dose reduction or discontinuation should be considered.
These symptoms can temp@@ orally deter@@ i@@ or@@ ate or can even ar@@ ise after discontinuation of treatment.
Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NM@@ S):
NMS is a potentially fatal sy@@ mp@@ to@@ m comple@@ x associated with antipsychotic medicinal products.
In clinical trials, rare cases of NMS were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
C@@ linical manifestations of NMS are hyper@@ pyrex@@ ia, muscle rigidi@@ ty, altered mental status and evidence of auton@@ o@@ mic in@@ stability (@@ irregular pul@@ se or blood pressure, tachycardia, di@@ ap@@ ho@@ re@@ sis and cardiac dy@@ s@@ rhythmi@@ a).
Additional signs may include elevated creatine phosp@@ hokinase, myo@@ globinur@@ ia (@@ rhabdomyoly@@ sis@@ ), and acute renal failure.
However, elevated creatine phosp@@ hokinase and rhabdomyolysis, not necessar@@ ily in association with NMS, have also been reported.
If a patient develop@@ s signs and symptoms indic@@ ative of NMS, or presents with unexplained high f@@ ever without additional clinical manifestations of NMS, all antipsychotic medicinal products, including ABILIFY, must be discontinued.
Sei@@ zu@@ re: in clinical trials, uncommon cases of seizure were reported during treatment with aripiprazole.
Therefore, aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients who have a history of seizure disorder or have conditions associated with seizu@@ res.
El@@ derly patients with dementia-related psycho@@ sis:
Increased mortal@@ ity: in three placebo-controlled trials (n= 938@@ ; mean age:
8@@ 2.@@ 4 years; range:
5@@ 6-@@ 99 year@@ s) of aripiprazole in elderly patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheim@@ er@@ 's disease, patients treated with aripiprazole were at increased risk of death compared to placebo.
The rate of death in aripiprazole-treated patients was 3.5% compared to 1.@@ 7% in the placebo group.
Although the causes of deaths were var@@ ie@@ d, most of the deaths appeared to be either cardiovascular (e. g. heart failure, sudden death@@ ) or infec@@ ti@@ ous (e. g. pneumon@@ ia) in nat@@ ure.
C@@ erebrovascular adverse ev@@ ents: in the same trials, cerebrovascular adverse events (e. g. stroke, transient ischaemic attack@@ ), including fataliti@@ es, were reported in patients (@@ mean age:
84 years; range:
78@@ -88 year@@ s).
Over@@ all, 1.@@ 3% of aripiprazole-treated patients reported cerebrovascular adverse events compared with 0.@@ 6% of placebo-treated patients in these trials.
This difference was not statistically signific@@ ant.
However, in one of these trials, a fixed-@@ dose trial, there was a significant dose response rel@@ ation@@ sh@@ ip for cerebrovascular adverse events in patients treated with aripiprazole.
ABILIFY is not approved for the treatment of dementia-related psycho@@ sis.
Hyper@@ glycaemia and Diabetes Mell@@ it@@ us: hyperglycaemia, in some cases extre@@ me and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, has been reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY.
Risk factors that may predispose patients to severe complications include obesity and family history of diabete@@ s.
In clinical trials with aripiprazole, there were no significant differences in the incidence rates of hyperglycaemia-related adverse events (including diabete@@ s) or in abnormal glycaemia laboratory values compared to placebo.
Prec@@ ise risk estima@@ tes for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with ABILIFY and with other atypical antipsychotic agents are not available to al@@ low direc@@ t compar@@ ison@@ s.
Patients treated with any antipsychotic agents, including ABILIFY, should be observed for signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (@@ such as poly@@ dip@@ sia, poly@@ uria, poly@@ pha@@ gia and weaknes@@ s) and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control.
9@@ 6 Weight gain: weight gain is common@@ ly seen in schizophrenic and bipolar mania patients due to co@@ - mor@@ bidi@@ ti@@ es, use of antipsychotics known to cause weight gain, po@@ or@@ ly managed life-@@ st@@ y@@ le, and might lead to severe complications.
Weight gain has been reported post-marketing among patients prescribed ABILIFY.
When se@@ en, it is usually in those with significant risk factors such as history of diabetes, thy@@ ro@@ id disorder or p@@ itu@@ it@@ ary adenom@@ a.
In clinical trials aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain (see section 5.1).
Dyspha@@ g@@ ia: oesopha@@ geal dy@@ smo@@ tility and aspiration have been associated with antipsychotic dru@@ g use, including ABILIFY.
Aripiprazole and other antipsychotic dru@@ gs should be used cauti@@ ously in patients at risk for aspiration pneumon@@ ia.
Hyper@@ sensitiv@@ ity: as with other medic@@ ations hypersensitivity reac@@ tions, characterised by allergic symptoms, may occur with aripiprazole (see section 4.8).
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Due to its α 1-adren@@ ergic receptor antagonis@@ m, aripiprazole has the potential to enhan@@ ce the effect of certain antihypertensive agents.
G@@ i@@ ven the primary CNS effects of aripiprazole, caution should be used when aripiprazole is taken in combination with al@@ cohol or other CNS medicinal products with over@@ l@@ app@@ ing undesirable effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).
If aripiprazole is administered concomitantly with medicines known to cause QT prolongation or electroly@@ te i@@ mb@@ al@@ ance, caution should be used.
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ABILIFY:
The administration of lor@@ azep@@ am solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole solution for injection when administered concomit@@ an@@ t@@ ly.
However, in a single-@@ dose, intramus@@ cular study of aripiprazole (@@ dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously with intramus@@ cular lor@@ azep@@ am (@@ dose 2 mg@@ ), the inten@@ sity of sedation was greater with the combination as compared to that observed with aripiprazole alone.
A ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ er, the H@@ 2 antagonist fa@@ motid@@ ine, reduc@@ es aripiprazole rate of absorption but this effect is de@@ emed not clinically relevan@@ t.
Aripiprazole is metabolised by multiple path@@ ways involving the CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 enzymes but not CYP1@@ A enzymes.
Thus, no dosage adjustment is required for smok@@ ers.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP2D6 (@@ quinid@@ ine) increased aripiprazole AUC by 107%, while Cmax was unchange@@ d.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, decreased by 32% and 47%.
ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose when concomitant administration of ABILIFY with quinid@@ ine occurs.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as flu@@ oxetin@@ e and par@@ oxetin@@ e, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
In a clinical trial in healthy subjects, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (@@ ketoconaz@@ ol@@ e) increased aripiprazole AUC and Cmax by 6@@ 3% and 37@@ %, respectively.
The AUC and Cmax of dehydro-aripiprazole increased by 77% and 43@@ %, respectively.
In CYP2D6 poor metabolis@@ ers, concomitant use of potent inhibitors of CYP3A4 may result in higher plasma concentrations of aripiprazole compared to that in CYP2D6 extensive metabol@@ iz@@ ers.
When consider@@ ing concomitant administration of ketoconaz@@ ole or other potent CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, potential benefits should out@@ weig@@ h the potential risks to the patient@@ .
When concomitant administration of keto@@ con@@ oz@@ ole with ABILIFY occurs, ABILIFY dose should be reduced to approximately one-half of its prescribed dose.
Other potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as it@@ ra@@ conaz@@ ole and HIV prote@@ ase inhibitor@@ s, may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose reductions should therefore be applied.
97 Upon discontinuation of the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor@@ , the dosage of ABILIFY should be increased to the level prior to the initiation of the concomitant therapy.
When we@@ a@@ k inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e. g@@ ., di@@ l@@ tiazem or esc@@ italopram) or CYP2D6 are used concomitantly with ABILIFY, mode@@ st increases in aripiprazole concentrations might be expec@@ ted.
Following concomitant administration of carbamazep@@ ine, a potent inducer of CYP3A4, the geometric means of Cmax and AUC for aripiprazole were 68% and 73% lower, respectively, compared to when aripiprazole (30 mg) was administered alone.
Si@@ mi@@ lar@@ ly, for dehydro-aripiprazole the geometric means of Cmax and AUC after carbamazep@@ ine co@@ -@@ administration were 69% and 71% lower, respectively, than those following treatment with aripiprazole alone.
ABILIFY dose should be dou@@ b@@ led when concomitant administration of ABILIFY occurs with carbamazep@@ ine.
J@@ oh@@ n@@ 's Wort@@ ) may be expected to have similar effects and similar dose increases should therefore be applied.
Upon discontinuation of potent CYP3A4 induc@@ ers, the dosage of ABILIFY should be reduced to the recommended dose.
When either valproate or lithium were administered concomitantly with aripiprazole, there was no clinically significant change in aripiprazole concentrations.
Potential for ABILIFY to affect other medicinal produc@@ ts:
The administration of aripiprazole solution for injection had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of lor@@ azep@@ am solution for injection when administered concomit@@ an@@ t@@ ly.
However, in a single-@@ dose, intramus@@ cular study of aripiprazole (@@ dose 15 mg) in healthy subjects, administered simultaneously with intramus@@ cular lor@@ azep@@ am (@@ dose 2 mg@@ ), the orthostatic hypotension observed was greater with the combination as compared to that observed with lor@@ azep@@ am alone.
In clinical studies, 10-30 mg/ day doses of aripiprazole had no significant effect on the metabolism of subst@@ rates of CYP2D6 (dextromethorphan@@ / 3-@@ meth@@ oxymorphin@@ an ratio@@ ), 2C9 (@@ war@@ farin), 2C19 (@@ om@@ ep@@ raz@@ ole@@ ), and 3A4 (dextromethorphan@@ ).
Addi@@ tion@@ al@@ ly, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole did not show potential for alter@@ ing CYP1A@@ 2-@@ mediated metabolism in vitro.
Thus, aripiprazole is unlikely to cause clinically important medicinal product inter@@ actions mediated by these enzymes.
When aripiprazole was administered concomitantly with either valproate or lithium@@ , there was no clinically important change in valproate or lithium concentrations.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled trials of aripiprazole in pregnant women.
An@@ imal studies could not exclu@@ de potential developmental toxicity (see section 5.3).
Patients should be advised to no@@ tif@@ y their physician if they become pregnant or inten@@ d to become pregnant during treatment with aripiprazole.
Due to insufficient safety information in humans and concern@@ s ra@@ ised by animal reproductive studies, this medicinal product should not be used in pregnancy unless the expected benefit clearly ju@@ sti@@ f@@ ies the potential risk to the foetus.
Aripiprazole was excreted in the mil@@ k of treated rats during lact@@ ation.
Patients should be advised not to breast fe@@ ed if they are taking aripiprazole.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effect on the ability to drive and use machines have been performe@@ d.
However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be cau@@ tion@@ ed about oper@@ ating haz@@ ard@@ ous machines, including mo@@ tor v@@ eh@@ ic@@ les, until they are reas@@ on@@ ably certain that aripiprazole does not affect them adver@@ se@@ ly.

In the long term 26-week maintenance phase of a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2% for aripiprazole-treated patients and 15.@@ 7% for placebo-treated patients.
In placebo-controlled trials, the incidence of akathisia in bipolar patients was 12@@ .1% with aripiprazole and 3.@@ 2% with placebo.
In schizophrenia patients the incidence of akathisia was 6.@@ 2% with aripiprazole and 3.@@ 0% with placebo.
99 Com@@ par@@ ison@@ s between aripiprazole and placebo in the propor@@ tions of patients experiencing potentially clinically significant changes in routine laboratory parameters revealed no medically important differenc@@ es.
E@@ lev@@ ations of CPK (C@@ reatine Phosphokinase), generally transient and asymptomati@@ c, were observed in 3.5% of aripiprazole treated patients as compared to 2.@@ 0% of patients who received placebo.
Other find@@ ing@@ s:
Undesirable effects known to be associated with antipsychotic therapy and also reported during treatment with aripiprazole include neur@@ oleptic malignant syn@@ dro@@ me, tardive dyskinesi@@ a, seizure, cerebrovascular adverse events and increased mortality in elderly demen@@ ted patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).

4.9 Overdose
In clinical trials and post-marketing experienc@@ e, accidental or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dosage of aripiprazole alone was identified in adult patients with reported estimated doses up to 1,@@ 260 mg with no fatalities.
The potentially medically important signs and symptoms observed included le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy, increased blood pressure, somnolence, tachycardia, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoe@@ a.
In addition, reports of accidental overdose with aripiprazole alone (@@ up to 195 mg) in children have been received with no fatalities.
The potentially medically serious signs and symptoms reported included somnolence, transient loss of consciousness and extrapyramidal symptoms.
Management of overdose should conc@@ ent@@ rate on supportive therapy, maintaining an adequate air@@ wa@@ y, oxy@@ gen@@ ation and ven@@ til@@ ation, and management of symptoms.
The possibility of multiple medicinal product invol@@ ve@@ ment should be considered.
There@@ fore cardiovascular monitoring should be started immediately and should include continu@@ ous elec@@ tro@@ cardi@@ ograph@@ ic monitoring to detec@@ t possible arrhythmias@@ .
Following any con@@ fir@@ med or suspected overdose with aripiprazole, clo@@ se medical supervision and monitoring should continue until the patient recover@@ s.
Ac@@ tiv@@ ated charcoal (@@ 50 g@@ ), administered one hour after aripiprazole, decreased aripiprazole Cmax by about 4@@ 1% and AUC by about 5@@ 1@@ %, sugge@@ sting that charcoal may be effective in the treatment of over@@ dose.
Although there is no information on the effect of haemodialysis in treat@@ ing an overdose with aripiprazole, haemodialysis is unlikely to be use@@ ful in overdose management since aripiprazole is high@@ ly bound to plasma protein@@ s.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antipsychotics, ATC code:
N05AX12
It has been propo@@ sed that aripiprazol@@ e’ s efficacy in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder is mediated through a combination of partial agonis@@ m at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and antagonis@@ m of serotonin 5HT2a receptors.
Aripiprazole exhibited antagonist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hyper@@ activity and agon@@ ist properties in animal models of dopaminergic hypo@@ activ@@ ity.
Aripiprazole exhibited high binding affinity in vitro for dopamine D2 and D@@ 3, serotonin 5HT1a and 5HT2a receptors and moderate affinity for dopamine D@@ 4, serotonin 5HT2@@ c and 5HT7@@ , alpha-@@ 1 adren@@ ergic and his@@ tamine H@@ 1 receptors.
Aripiprazole also exhibited moderate binding affinity for the serotonin re@@ up@@ take site and no ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ able affinity for mus@@ car@@ in@@ ic receptors.
Interaction with receptors other than dopamine and serotonin sub@@ types may expla@@ in some of the other clinical effects of aripiprazole.
Aripiprazole doses rang@@ ing from 0.5 to 30 mg administered once a day to healthy subjects for 2 weeks produced a dose-dependent reduction in the binding of 11C-@@ ra@@ clo@@ pri@@ de, a D2@@ / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ and, to the cau@@ date and p@@ uta@@ men detected by posit@@ ron e@@ mission tom@@ og@@ ra@@ phy@@ .
10@@ 1 Further information on clinical trial@@ s:
A@@ g@@ it@@ ation in schizophrenia and Bipolar I Disorder with aripiprazole solution for injection:
In two short@@ - term (2@@ 4-@@ h@@ our@@ ) placebo-controlled trials involving 5@@ 5@@ 4 schizophrenic patients presenting with agit@@ ation and di@@ st@@ ur@@ bed behavi@@ ours, aripiprazole solution for injection was associated with statistically significant greater improvements in agit@@ ation@@ / behavi@@ ou@@ ral symptoms compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol@@ .
In one short-term (2@@ 4-@@ h@@ our@@ ) placebo-controlled trial involving 2@@ 91 patients with bipolar disorder presenting with agit@@ ation and di@@ st@@ ur@@ bed behavi@@ ours, aripiprazole solution for injection was associated with statistically significant greater improvements in agit@@ ation@@ / behavi@@ ou@@ ral symptoms compared to placebo and was similar to the ref@@ eren@@ ce ar@@ m lor@@ azep@@ am@@ .
The observed mean improvement from baseline on the PANSS Exc@@ it@@ e@@ ment Com@@ pon@@ ent s@@ core at the primary 2-@@ hour end@@ point was 5.@@ 8 for placebo, 9.@@ 6 for lor@@ azep@@ am@@ , and 8.7 for aripiprazole.
In sub@@ population analy@@ ses on patients with mixed episodes or on patients with severe agitation, a similar p@@ at@@ tern of efficacy to the overall population was observed but statisti@@ cal significance could not be established due to a reduced samp@@ le siz@@ e.
Schizophren@@ ia with oral aripiprazol@@ e:
In three short-term (4 to 6 weeks) placebo-controlled trials involving 1,@@ 228 schizophrenic patients, presenting with posi@@ tive or negative symptoms, oral aripiprazole was associated with statistically significantly greater improvements in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.
ABILIFY is effective in maintaining the clinical improvement during continu@@ ation therapy in patients who have shown an initial treatment respon@@ se.
In a haloperidol@@ -controlled trial, the proportion of respon@@ der patients maintaining response to medicinal product at 52-@@ weeks was similar in both groups (@@ oral aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).
The overall completion rate was significantly higher for patients on oral aripiprazole (43%) than for oral haloperidol (30%).
Ac@@ tu@@ al s@@ co@@ res in ra@@ ting scal@@ es used as secondary end@@ po@@ in@@ ts, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asber@@ g Depres@@ sion R@@ ating Scale showed a significant improvement over haloperidol@@ .
In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schizophrenia, oral aripiprazole had significantly greater reduction in rel@@ ap@@ se rate, 34% in oral aripiprazole group and 57% in placebo.
Weight gain: in clinical trials oral aripiprazole has not been shown to induce clinically relevant weight gain.
In a 26-week, olanzap@@ ine-@@ controlled, double-blind, multi@@ -@@ national study of schizophrenia which included 314 patients and where the primary en@@ d-@@ point was weight gain, significantly less patients had at least 7% weight gain over baseline (i. e. a gain of at least 5.@@ 6 kg for a mean baseline weight of ~@@ 8@@ 0.5 kg) on oral aripiprazole (N= 18@@ , or 13% of evaluable patient@@ s), compared to oral olanzap@@ ine (N= 45@@ , or 3@@ 3% of evaluable patients).
Manic episodes in Bipolar I Disorder with oral aripiprazol@@ e:
In two 3-week, flexib@@ le-@@ dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trials involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo in reduction of manic symptoms over 3 weeks.
These trials included patients with or without psychotic feat@@ u@@ res and with or without a rapid@@ -@@ cy@@ cling cour@@ se.
In one 3-week, fixed-@@ dose, placebo-controlled monotherapy trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, aripiprazole failed to demonstrate superior efficacy to placebo.
In two 12-@@ week, placebo@@ - and activ@@ e-@@ controlled monotherapy trials in patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, aripiprazole demonstrated superior efficacy to placebo at week 3 and a maintenance of effect comparable to lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
Aripiprazole also demonstrated a comparable proportion of patients in symptomatic remission from mania as lithium or haloperidol at week 12.
In a 6-@@ week, placebo-controlled trial involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of Bipolar I Disorder, with or without psychotic features, who were par@@ tially non-@@ respon@@ sive to lithium or valproate monotherapy for 2 weeks at therapeutic serum level@@ s, the addition of aripiprazole as adj@@ unc@@ tive therapy resul@@ ted in superior efficacy in reduction of manic symptoms than lithium or valproate mono@@ therapy.
10@@ 2 In a 26-week, placebo-controlled trial, followed by a 7@@ 4-@@ week exten@@ sion, in manic patients who achieved remission on aripiprazole during a stab@@ ili@@ z@@ ation phase prior to ran@@ do@@ mi@@ z@@ ation, aripiprazole demonstrated superiority over placebo in preventing bipolar recur@@ ren@@ c@@ e, primarily in preventing recurrence into mania but failed to demonstrate superiority over placebo in preventing recurrence into depression.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion:
Aripiprazole solution for injection administered intramus@@ cul@@ arly as a single-@@ dose to healthy subjects is well absor@@ bed and has an absolute bioavailability of 100@@ %.
The aripiprazole AUC in the first 2 hours after an intramus@@ cular injection was 9@@ 0% greater than the AUC after the same dose as a table@@ t; systemic exposure was generally similar between the 2 form@@ ul@@ ations.
In 2 studies in healthy subjects the medi@@ an times to the peak plasma concentrations were 1 and 3 hours after dos@@ ing.
Dis@@ tribu@@ tion:
Aripiprazole is wide@@ ly distribu@@ ted throughout the body with an apparent volume of distribution of 4.9 l/ kg, indicating extensive extra@@ vascular distribu@@ tion.
At therapeutic concentr@@ ations, aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole are greater than 99% bound to serum protein@@ s, binding primarily to album@@ in.
Metabolis@@ m@@ :
Aripiprazole is exten@@ sively metabolised by the liver primarily by three bio@@ trans@@ formation pathwa@@ y@@ s: dehydrogen@@ ation, hydrox@@ yl@@ ation, and N-dealk@@ yl@@ ation.
Based on in vitro studies, CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 enzymes are responsible for dehydrogen@@ ation and hydrox@@ ylation of aripiprazole, and N-dealk@@ ylation is cataly@@ sed by CYP3A@@ 4.
Aripiprazole is the predomin@@ ant medicinal product mo@@ iety in systemic circulation.
At ste@@ ady state, dehydro-aripiprazole, the active metabolite, re@@ presents about 40% of aripiprazole AUC in plas@@ ma@@ .
Elimination:
The mean elimin@@ ation half-@@ li@@ ves for aripiprazole are approximately 75 hours in extensive metabolisers of CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in poor metabolisers of CYP2D6.
The total body clearance of aripiprazole is 0.7 m@@ l/ min@@ / kg, which is primarily hep@@ ati@@ c.
Following a single oral dose of [@@ 14@@ C@@ ]@@ -@@ labelled aripiprazole, approximately 27% of the administered radio@@ activity was recovered in the urine and approximately 60% in the faeces.
L@@ ess than 1% of unchanged aripiprazole was excreted in the urine and approximately 18% was recovered unchanged in the faeces.
Pharmacokineti@@ cs in special patient groups
Elderly:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy elderly and yo@@ unger adult subjects, nor is there any detectable effect of age in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Gender:
There are no differences in the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole between healthy male and female subjects nor is there any detectable effect of gen@@ der in a population pharmacokinetic analysis in schizophrenic patients.
Smoking and Rac@@ e:
Pop@@ ulation pharmacokinetic evaluation has revealed no evidence of clinically significant rac@@ e-@@ related differences or effects from smo@@ king upon the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole.
10@@ 3 Renal Disease:
The pharmacokinetic characteristics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were found to be similar in patients with severe renal disease compared to yo@@ ung healthy subjec@@ ts.
Hep@@ atic Disease:
A single-@@ dose study in subjects with var@@ y@@ ing de@@ gre@@ es of liver cirrho@@ sis (Child-Pugh C@@ las@@ ses A, B, and C) did not reve@@ al a significant effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with C@@ lass C liver cirrho@@ sis, which is insufficient to dra@@ w conc@@ lu@@ sions on their metabolic cap@@ ac@@ ity.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
Adminis@@ tr@@ ation of aripiprazole solution for injection was well tol@@ erated and produced no direc@@ t target or@@ g@@ an toxicity in rats or monkeys after repeated dosing at systemic exposures (AUC) that were 15 and 5 ti@@ me@@ s, respectively, human exposure at the maximum recommended human dose of 30 mg intramus@@ cul@@ ar@@ .
In intravenous reproductive toxicity studies, no new safety concern@@ s were observed at maternal exposures up to 15 (@@ ra@@ t@@ ) and 29 (@@ ra@@ bb@@ it@@ ) times human exposure at 30 mg.
Non-@@ clinical safety data revealed no special hazard for humans based on conventional oral aripiprazole studies of safety pharmac@@ olog@@ y, repe@@ at-@@ dose toxicity, geno@@ toxicity, carcinogenic potenti@@ al, and toxicity to reproduc@@ tion.
Tox@@ ic@@ olog@@ ically significant effects were observed only at doses or exposures that were suff@@ ici@@ ently in excess of the maximum human dose or exposu@@ re, indicating that these effects were limit@@ ed or of no relev@@ ance to clinical use.
These include@@ d: dose-dependent adrenocortical toxicity (@@ l@@ ipofusc@@ in pig@@ ment accumul@@ ation and/ or par@@ enchy@@ mal cell loss@@ ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg/ kg/ day (3 to 10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human do@@ se) and increased adrenocortical carcinomas and com@@ bin@@ ed adrenocortical adenom@@ as@@ / carcinomas in female rats at 60 mg/ kg/ day (10 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended human do@@ se@@ ).
The highest n@@ on@@ tumor@@ igen@@ ic exposure in female rats was 7 times the human exposure at the recommended dose.
An additional fin@@ ding was ch@@ olelithiasis as a con@@ sequ@@ ence of precip@@ it@@ ation of sulphate conjugates of hydroxy metabolites of aripiprazole in the bile of monkeys after repeated oral dosing at 25 to 125 mg/ kg/ day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose 2 or 16 to 81 times the maximum recommended human dose based on mg/ m).
However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of hydroxy aripiprazole in human bile at the highest dose propo@@ sed, 30 mg per da@@ y, were no more than 6% of the bile concentrations found in the monkeys in the 39@@ -@@ week study and are well below (6%) their limit@@ s of in vitro solu@@ bil@@ ity.
Based on results of a full range of standard geno@@ toxicity te@@ st@@ s, aripiprazole was considered non-@@ geno@@ toxic@@ .
Aripiprazole did not impa@@ ir fer@@ tility in reproductive toxicity studies.
D@@ ev@@ e@@ lo@@ p@@ mental toxicity, including dose-dependent dela@@ y@@ ed foetal ossification and possible ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects, were observed in rats at doses resulting in sub@@ therapeutic exposures (@@ based on AUC) and in ra@@ bb@@ its at doses resulting in exposures 3 and 11 times the mean steady-state AUC at the maximum recommended clinical dose.
Matern@@ al toxicity occurred at doses similar to those e@@ lic@@ it@@ ing developmental toxic@@ ity.

What is Abraxan@@ e@@ ?
Abraxane is a powder that is made up into a suspension for infusion (@@ dri@@ p into a v@@ ein@@ ).
It contains the active substance paclitaxel (@@ 5 mg/ m@@ l).
What is Abraxane used for@@ ?
Abraxane is used to treat metastatic breast cancer in patients whose first treatment for their metastatic disease has stopped wor@@ king and for whom standard treatment including an ‘ an@@ thracyclin@@ e’ (@@ a type of anti@@ cancer medicin@@ e) is not suit@@ able@@ . ‘ Meta@@ stati@@ c@@ ’ means that the cancer has sp@@ read to other par@@ ts of the bo@@ dy.
Abraxane is used on its o@@ w@@ n.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Abraxane use@@ d?
Abraxane should only be given under the supervision of a speci@@ al@@ ist cancer doctor in war@@ ds that are speci@@ alised in gi@@ ving ‘ cy@@ to@@ toxic@@ ’ (@@ cell@@ -@@ k@@ il@@ lin@@ g@@ ) medicin@@ es.
The recommended dose is 260 mg per s@@ qu@@ are me@@ tr@@ e of body surface are@@ a (@@ cal@@ cul@@ ated using the patient ’ s h@@ eight and weigh@@ t).
It is given over a period of 30 minutes, e@@ very three weeks.
The dose may be reduced or treatment inter@@ ru@@ p@@ ted in patients who have certain side effects affec@@ ting the blood or the nerv@@ es.
Abraxane should not be used in patients who have severe problems with their li@@ ver@@ .
The appropriate doses for patients with mild or moderate liver problems or with kidney problems are not kno@@ w@@ n.
How does Abraxane wor@@ k@@ ?
The active substance in Abraxan@@ e, paclitaxel@@ , be@@ lon@@ gs to the group of anti@@ cancer medicines known as the ‘ ta@@ x@@ an@@ es@@ ’@@ .
Paclitaxel block@@ s the ability of cancer cells to brea@@ k do@@ wn their inter@@ n@@ al ‘ skele@@ ton ’ that al@@ low@@ s them to divi@@ de and multip@@ ly.
W@@ it@@ h their skele@@ ton sti@@ l@@ l in plac@@ e, the cells cannot divi@@ de and they ev@@ ent@@ u@@ ally di@@ e.
Abraxane also affec@@ ts non-@@ cancer cells such as blood and n@@ er@@ ve cell@@ s, which can cause side effec@@ ts.
Paclitaxel has been available as an anti@@ cancer medicine since 1@@ 99@@ 3.
Con@@ ven@@ tional types of paclitaxel contain subst@@ anc@@ es (@@ sol@@ vent@@ s) that dis@@ sol@@ ve the paclitaxel@@ , but can cause side effec@@ ts.
Abraxane does not contain these sol@@ v@@ ents.

How has Abraxane been studi@@ ed@@ ?
The effects of Abraxane were first te@@ s@@ ted in experim@@ ent@@ al models before being studied in humans.
The comp@@ any also presen@@ ted data from the p@@ ub@@ lis@@ hed lit@@ erat@@ ure.
The effectiveness of Abraxane has been studied in one main study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer, around th@@ re@@ e-@@ qu@@ arter@@ s of whom had received an an@@ thracyclin@@ e in the pa@@ st.
A@@ ro@@ und half of the patients in the study had al@@ ready received treat@@ ments for their cancer after it had become meta@@ stati@@ c.
The effects of Abraxane (@@ given on its o@@ wn@@ ) were compared with those of a conventional paclitaxel@@ - containing medicine (@@ given to@@ ge@@ ther with other medicines to reduce side effec@@ ts@@ ).
The main me@@ as@@ ure of effectiveness was the number of patients who ‘ responded ’ after at least five weeks of treatment.
This was defined as the patient@@ ’ s main tumours having dis@@ appeared or having sh@@ r@@ un@@ k in siz@@ e by at least 30@@ %.
What benefit has Abraxane shown during the studi@@ es@@ ?
Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel@@ -@@ containing medicin@@ es.
Over@@ all, in the main stu@@ d@@ y, 72 (@@ 3@@ 1@@ %) of the 2@@ 29 women receiving Abraxane responded to treatment, compared with 37 (1@@ 6@@ %) of the 2@@ 25 receiving conventional paclitaxel@@ -@@ containing medicin@@ es.
When look@@ ing only at the patients who were receiving their first treatment for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the medicines in ter@@ ms of measures of effectiveness such as the time until the disease go@@ t wor@@ se and sur@@ viv@@ al.
In contra@@ st, in patients who had taken other treat@@ ments for metastatic breast cancer be@@ fore, these additional measures showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel@@ -@@ containing medicin@@ es.
Therefore, the comp@@ any with@@ dre@@ w its applic@@ ation for the use of Abraxane as fir@@ st-@@ line treatment during the assessment of the medicine.
What is the risk associated with Abraxan@@ e@@ ?
The most common side effects with Abraxane (@@ seen in more than 1 patient in 10@@ ) are neutropen@@ ia (@@ low levels of ne@@ utrophil@@ s, a type of white blood cell@@ ), anaemia (@@ low red blood cell co@@ un@@ ts@@ ), leu@@ c@@ open@@ ia (@@ low levels of leu@@ c@@ ocy@@ tes, a type of white blood cell@@ ), thrombocytopen@@ ia (@@ low blood platelet co@@ un@@ ts@@ ), lymph@@ open@@ ia (@@ low levels of lymph@@ ocy@@ tes, a type of white blood cell@@ ), peripheral neuropath@@ y (n@@ er@@ ve da@@ ma@@ ge in the han@@ ds and fe@@ et@@ ), neuropath@@ y (n@@ er@@ ve da@@ ma@@ ge@@ ), hypo@@ a@@ es@@ th@@ esi@@ a (@@ reduced sen@@ se of t@@ ou@@ ch@@ ), para@@ es@@ th@@ esi@@ a (@@ unusual sen@@ s@@ ations like p@@ ins and ne@@ e@@ dle@@ s), nau@@ se@@ a (@@ feeling si@@ ck@@ ), diarrhoe@@ a, vomiting, constipation, stom@@ ati@@ tis (@@ inflammation of the lin@@ ing of the mouth@@ ), alop@@ ec@@ ia (@@ hair loss@@ ), rash, ar@@ th@@ r@@ al@@ gia (@@ joint pain@@ ), my@@ al@@ gia (@@ muscle pain@@ ), an@@ ore@@ xi@@ a (loss of appeti@@ te@@ ), fatigue (@@ tired@@ nes@@ s), as@@ th@@ en@@ ia (@@ weaknes@@ s) and py@@ re@@ xi@@ a (@@ fe@@ ver@@ ).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Abraxan@@ e, see the Package Leafle@@ t.
Abraxane should not be used in people who may be hyper@@ sensi@@ tive (allerg@@ ic@@ ) to paclitaxel or any of the other ingredi@@ ents.
It should also not be used in patients who are breast fe@@ eding or who have low levels of ne@@ utrophil@@ s in the blood before starting treatment.
W@@ h@@ y has Abraxane been appro@@ ve@@ d?
The Com@@ mitte@@ e for Medicinal Produc@@ ts for H@@ uman Use (CHMP) no@@ ted that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel@@ -@@ containing medicines in patients whose first treatment had stopped wor@@ k@@ ing, and th@@ at, un@@ like other paclitaxel@@ -@@ containing medicines, it does not need other medicines to reduce side effec@@ ts.
The Com@@ mitte@@ e dec@@ ided that Abraxan@@ e’ s benefits are greater than its risks for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed fir@@ st-@@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom stand@@ ar@@ d, an@@ thracyclin@@ e-@@ containing therapy is not indicated.
The Com@@ mitte@@ e recommended that Abraxane be given marketing authoris@@ ation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Abraxane monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients who have failed fir@@ st-@@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for whom stand@@ ar@@ d, an@@ thracyclin@@ e containing therapy is not indicated (See also section 4.4).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Abraxane should only be administered under the supervision of a qual@@ if@@ ied onc@@ olog@@ ist in units speci@@ alised in the administration of cy@@ to@@ toxic agents.
The proce@@ dur@@ e for recon@@ stitution is described in section 6.@@ 6.
The recommended dose of Abraxane is 260 mg/ m2 administered intravenously over 30 minu@@ tes e@@ very 3 weeks.
Dose adjustments during treatment:
Patients who experience severe neutropen@@ ia (@@ ne@@ utrop@@ h@@ il count < 0.@@ 50 x 109@@ / l for a week or lon@@ ger@@ ) or severe sensor@@ y neuropath@@ y during Abraxane therapy should have the dose reduced to 2@@ 20 mg/ m2 for sub@@ sequ@@ ent cour@@ ses.
Following recurrence of severe neutropen@@ ia or severe sensor@@ y neuropath@@ y, additional dose reduction should be made to 18@@ 0 mg/ m@@ 2.
Abraxane should not be administered until ne@@ utrop@@ h@@ il counts rec@@ over to > 1@@ .5 x 109@@ / l.
For gra@@ de 3 sensor@@ y neuropath@@ y with@@ hold treatment until re@@ solution to gra@@ de 1 or 2@@ , followed by a dose reduction for all sub@@ sequ@@ ent cour@@ ses.
2 Patients with hepatic impairment:
In@@ suff@@ icient data are curr@@ ently available to recommen@@ d dose mo@@ di@@ f@@ ic@@ ations in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (see sections 4.@@ 4. and 5.2).
Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with paclitaxel.
Patients with impa@@ i@@ red renal f@@ unc@@ tion:
Studies in patients with impa@@ i@@ red renal fun@@ ction have not been performed and insufficient data are curr@@ ently available to recommen@@ d dose mo@@ di@@ f@@ ic@@ ations in patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2).
Paediatric patients:
Abraxane is not recommended for use in children below age 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficac@@ y.
El@@ derly patients:
In the clinical studies, no toxic@@ i@@ ties occurred not@@ ably more frequently among elderly patients who received Abraxane.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Lac@@ t@@ ation.
Patients who have baseline ne@@ utrop@@ h@@ il counts < 1@@ .5 x 109@@ / l.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Abraxane is an album@@ in-@@ bound n@@ an@@ op@@ ar@@ tic@@ le form@@ ulation of paclitaxel@@ , which may have subst@@ anti@@ ally different pharmacological properties compared to other form@@ ul@@ ations of paclitaxel (see sections 5.1 and 5.@@ 2@@ )@@ .@@ .
Hyper@@ sensitiv@@ ity:
If hypersensitivity occurs, the medicinal product should be discontinued immediate@@ ly, symptomatic treatment should be initi@@ ate@@ d, and that patient should not be re@@ ch@@ all@@ en@@ ged with paclitaxel.
Hae@@ matolog@@ y:
B@@ one marrow su@@ p@@ pres@@ sion (@@ primarily neutropen@@ ia) occurs frequently with Abraxane.
Neutropen@@ ia is dose-dependent and a dose-@@ limit@@ ing toxic@@ ity.
F@@ requ@@ ent monitoring of blood cell counts should be performed during Abraxane therapy.
Patients should not be re@@ treated with sub@@ sequ@@ ent cy@@ cle@@ s of Abraxane until ne@@ utrophil@@ s rec@@ over to > 1@@ .5 x 109@@ / l and platele@@ ts rec@@ over to > 100 x 109@@ / l.
Neuropath@@ y:
S@@ en@@ sor@@ y neuropath@@ y occurs frequently with Abraxan@@ e, although development of severe symptoms is less common@@ .
The occurrence of gra@@ de 1 or 2 sensor@@ y neuropath@@ y does not generally require dose reduc@@ tion.
If gra@@ de 3 sensor@@ y neuropath@@ y develop@@ s, treatment should be with@@ hel@@ d until re@@ solution to gra@@ de 1 or 2 followed by a dose reduction for all sub@@ sequ@@ ent cour@@ ses of Abraxane is recommended (see section 4.@@ 2).
3 Hep@@ atic Imp@@ air@@ ment@@ :
Patients with hepatic impairment may be at increased risk of toxicity, particularly from myelo@@ su@@ p@@ pres@@ sion, and such patients should be closely monitored for development of pro@@ found myelo@@ su@@ p@@ pres@@ sion.
The use of Abraxane has not been form@@ ally studied in patients specifically with hepatic impairment.
Patients with severe hepatic impairment (@@ bili@@ rub@@ in > 5 x UL@@ N or A@@ S@@ L@@ / ALT > 10 x UL@@ N@@ ) should not be treated with Abraxane.
The appropriate dose regimen in patients with less severe hepatic impairment is un@@ kno@@ w@@ n.
Car@@ dio@@ toxic@@ ity:
W@@ h@@ ile car@@ dio@@ toxicity un@@ equ@@ iv@@ oc@@ ally related to Abraxane has not been demonst@@ ra@@ ted, cardiac events are not uncommon in the indicated popul@@ ation, especially in patients who have previ@@ ously received an@@ thracyclin@@ es or have underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease.
Th@@ us patients receiving Abraxane should be vigil@@ antly monitored by physici@@ ans for the occurrence of cardiac events.
S@@ ex@@ u@@ ally active men and women should use effective meth@@ o@@ ds of contra@@ c@@ ep@@ tion during treatment and up to si@@ x months after treatment for men, and one month after treatment for women (see section 4.@@ 6@@ ).
The effectiveness and safety of Abraxane in patients with c@@ ent@@ ral nerv@@ ous system (C@@ N@@ S@@ ) metasta@@ ses has not been established.
CNS metasta@@ ses are generally not well controlled by systemic chemotherapy.
Gastrointestinal Symptom@@ s:
If patients experience nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea following the administration of Abraxan@@ e, they may be treated with common@@ ly used anti-@@ e@@ me@@ tic@@ s and constip@@ ating agents.
Excipi@@ ents:
When reconstitu@@ ted, Abraxane contains approximately 4@@ 25 mg sodium per dose.
T@@ o be taken into consideration by patients on a controlled sodium di@@ et.
4.5 Inter@@ actions with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performe@@ d.
The metabolism of paclitaxel is cataly@@ sed, in par@@ t, by cy@@ t@@ och@@ ro@@ me P@@ 450 iso@@ enzymes CYP2@@ C@@ 8 and CYP3A4 (see section 5.2).
Therefore, caution should be ex@@ er@@ c@@ ised when adminis@@ ter@@ ing paclitaxel concomitantly with medicines known to in@@ hibit (e. g. erythro@@ my@@ c@@ in, flu@@ oxetin@@ e, i@@ mi@@ da@@ z@@ ole anti@@ fung@@ al@@ s) or induce (e. g. ri@@ fa@@ mp@@ icin, carbamazep@@ ine, phen@@ ytoin, e@@ favirenz, ne@@ virap@@ ine) either CYP2@@ C@@ 8 or CYP3A@@ 4.
Abraxane is indicated for mono@@ -@@ therapy.
Abraxane should not be used in combination with other anti@@ cancer agents.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Pregn@@ anc@@ y:
There are very limit@@ ed data on the use of paclitaxel in human pregn@@ anc@@ y.
Paclitaxel is suspected to cause serious b@@ ir@@ th def@@ ects when administered during pregn@@ anc@@ y.
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Abraxane should not be used in pregn@@ anc@@ y, and in women of ch@@ ild@@ be@@ ar@@ ing potential not using effective contra@@ c@@ ep@@ tion, unless the clinical condition of the mo@@ ther requires treatment with paclitaxel.
4 W@@ omen of ch@@ ild@@ be@@ ar@@ ing potential should use effective contra@@ c@@ ep@@ tion during and up to 1 month after receiving treatment with Abraxane.
M@@ ale patients treated with Abraxane are advised not to fa@@ ther a ch@@ il@@ d during and up to si@@ x months after treatment.
Lac@@ t@@ ation:
It is not known if paclitaxel is excreted in human mil@@ k@@ .
Be@@ cause of potential serious adverse reactions in breast-feeding inf@@ an@@ ts, Abraxane is contraindicated during lact@@ ation.
Brea@@ st@@ fe@@ eding must be discontinued for the dur@@ ation of therapy.
F@@ er@@ til@@ ity:
Abraxane induced inf@@ er@@ tility in male rats (see section 5.3).
M@@ ale patients should se@@ ek advice on con@@ ser@@ vation of sper@@ m prior to treatment because of the possibility of ir@@ re@@ ver@@ sible inf@@ er@@ tility due to therapy with Abraxane.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abraxane has min@@ or or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Abraxane may cause side effects such as tiredness (@@ very common@@ ) and dizzin@@ ess (@@ common@@ ) that may affect the ability to drive and use machin@@ er@@ y.
Patients should be advised not to drive and use machines if they feel ti@@ red or dizz@@ y.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The following are the most common and important inc@@ iden@@ c@@ es of adverse reactions related to 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg/ m2 Abraxane once e@@ very three weeks in the p@@ iv@@ o@@ tal phase II@@ I clinical study.
Blood and lymphatic system disorders:
Neutropen@@ ia was the most not@@ able important haematological toxicity (@@ reported in 7@@ 9% of patient@@ s), and was rapid@@ ly re@@ ver@@ sible and dose depend@@ ent@@ ; leukopen@@ ia was reported in 71% of patients.
Gra@@ de 4 neutropen@@ ia (< 0.5 x 109@@ / l) occurred in 9% of patients treated with Abraxane.
F@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neutropen@@ ia occurred in four patients on Abraxane.

Lymph@@ open@@ ia was observed in 4@@ 5% of the patients.
Nervous system disorders:
In gener@@ al, the frequency and sever@@ ity of n@@ euro@@ toxicity was dose-dependent in patients receiving Abraxane.
Per@@ iph@@ eral neuropath@@ y (@@ mo@@ st@@ ly Gra@@ de 1 or 2 sensor@@ y neuropath@@ y) was observed in 68% of patients on Abraxane with 10@@ % being Gra@@ de 3, and no cases of Gra@@ de 4.
Gastrointestinal disorders:
N@@ au@@ se@@ a occurred in 2@@ 9% of the patients and diarrhoea in 25% of the patients.
Skin and subcutaneous system disorders:
Alo@@ pec@@ ia was observed in 9@@ 0% of the patients treated with Abraxane.
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders:
Ar@@ th@@ r@@ al@@ gia occurred in 32% of patients on Abraxane and was severe in 6% of cases.
Myal@@ gia occurred in 2@@ 4% of patients on Abraxane and was severe in 7% of cases.
The symptoms were usually transi@@ ent@@ , typ@@ ically occurred three days after Abraxane administration and re@@ sol@@ ved within a week.
General disorders and administration site disorders:
As@@ th@@ en@@ ia@@ / Fatigue was reported in 40% of the patients.
T@@ able 1 lis@@ ts adverse reactions associated with the administration of Abraxane to patients from studies in which Abraxane has been administered as a single ag@@ ent at any dose in any indication (@@ N = 78@@ 9@@ ).
5 The frequency of undesirable effects listed in table 1 is defined using the following conven@@ tion:

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group:
Ta@@ x@@ an@@ es, ATC C@@ ode:
L@@ 0@@ 1@@ C@@ D@@ 01
Paclitaxel is an anti@@ micro@@ tub@@ ule ag@@ ent that pro@@ mo@@ tes the asse@@ mb@@ ly of micro@@ tu@@ bu@@ les from tub@@ ul@@ in di@@ m@@ ers and stabil@@ is@@ es micro@@ tu@@ bu@@ les by preventing de@@ poly@@ m@@ er@@ is@@ ation.
This stability results in the in@@ hib@@ i@@ tion of the normal dynamic re@@ organ@@ isation of the micro@@ tub@@ ule n@@ et@@ wor@@ k that is essen@@ tial for vit@@ al inter@@ phase and mit@@ oti@@ c cell@@ ular f@@ unc@@ tion@@ s.
In addition, paclitaxel induc@@ es abnormal ar@@ ra@@ ys or “ b@@ und@@ les ” of micro@@ tu@@ bu@@ les throughout the cell cy@@ cle and multiple a@@ st@@ ers of micro@@ tu@@ bu@@ les during mito@@ sis.
Abraxane contains human serum album@@ in-@@ paclitaxel n@@ an@@ op@@ ar@@ tic@@ le@@ s.
Album@@ in is known to mediate endo@@ the@@ li@@ al trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma con@@ stitu@@ ents and in vitro studies demonstrated that the presence of album@@ in enhan@@ c@@ es transport of paclitaxel across endo@@ the@@ li@@ al cells.
It is hy@@ poth@@ es@@ ised that this enhan@@ ced tran@@ sen@@ do@@ the@@ li@@ al transport is mediated by the g@@ p@@ -@@ 60 album@@ in recep@@ tor@@ , and that there is accumul@@ ation of paclitaxel in the are@@ a of tumour due to the album@@ in-@@ binding protein SP@@ AR@@ C (@@ sec@@ reted protein ac@@ i@@ dic ri@@ ch in cy@@ ste@@ ine@@ ).
Bre@@ ast carcinom@@ a:
Dat@@ a from 10@@ 6 patients acc@@ ru@@ ed in two single-@@ ar@@ m open-label studies and from 45@@ 4 patients treated in a random@@ ised Pha@@ se II@@ I compar@@ ative study are available to suppor@@ t the use of Abraxane in metastatic breast cancer.
This information is presen@@ ted below.
S@@ ing@@ le-@@ ar@@ m open-label studies
In one stu@@ d@@ y, Abraxane was administered as a 30@@ -@@ min@@ ute infusion at a dose of 1@@ 75 mg/ m2 to 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer.
The secon@@ d trial u@@ ti@@ lis@@ ed a dose of 300 mg/ m2 as a 30 min@@ ute infusion in 6@@ 3 patients with metastatic breast cancer.
Patients were treated without ster@@ o@@ id pre@@ - treatment or pl@@ ann@@ ed G-CSF suppor@@ t.
C@@ y@@ cle@@ s were administered at 3 week interv@@ als.
The response rates in all patients were 39@@ .@@ 5% (95% CI:
2@@ 4.@@ 9% - 5@@ 4.@@ 2@@ %) and 47@@ .6%
3@@ 5.@@ 3% - 6@@ 0.@@ 0@@ %), respectively.
The medi@@ an time to disease progression was 5.3 months (1@@ 75 mg/ m@@ 2@@ ; 95% CI:
4.6 – 6.2 month@@ s) and 6.1 months (@@ 300 mg/ m@@ 2@@ ; 95% CI:
4.2 – 9.@@ 8 month@@ s).
Random@@ ised compar@@ ative study@@ :
This multi@@ -@@ c@@ entr@@ e trial was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer, who were treated e@@ very 3 weeks with single-@@ ag@@ ent paclitaxel@@ , either as sol@@ vent@@ -@@ based paclitaxel 1@@ 75 mg/ m2 given as a 3-@@ hour infusion with pre@@ medic@@ ation to pre@@ v@@ ent hypersensitivity (@@ N = 2@@ 25@@ ), or as Abraxane 260 mg/ m2 given as a 30 min@@ ute infusion without pre@@ medic@@ ation (@@ N = 2@@ 29@@ ).
Si@@ x@@ t@@ y@@ -f@@ our perc@@ ent of patients had impa@@ i@@ red perfor@@ man@@ ce status (E@@ CO@@ G 1 or 2) at study entr@@ y; 7@@ 9% had vis@@ c@@ eral metasta@@ se@@ s; and 7@@ 6% had > 3 sit@@ es of metasta@@ ses.
F@@ our@@ te@@ en perc@@ ent of the patients had not received prior chemotherap@@ y; 27% had received chemotherapy in the adj@@ u@@ v@@ ant setting on@@ ly, 40% in the metastatic setting on@@ ly, and 19% in both metastatic and adj@@ u@@ v@@ ant se@@ tt@@ ing@@ s.

5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of total paclitaxel following 30@@ - and 18@@ 0@@ -@@ min@@ ute infusion@@ s of Abraxane at dose levels of 80 to 375 mg/ m2 were determined in clinical studies.
The dru@@ g exposure (AUC) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g. hr@@ / ml following dosing from 80 to 300 mg/ m@@ 2.
Following intravenous administration of Abraxane to patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg/ m@@ 2@@ , paclitaxel plasma concentrations de@@ clin@@ ed in a multi@@ pha@@ si@@ c man@@ n@@ er.
The mean Cmax of paclitaxel@@ , which occurred at the end of the infusion, was 18.@@ 7 µ@@ g/ ml.
The mean total clearance was 15 l/ hr@@ / m@@ 2.
The ter@@ min@@ al half-life was about 27 hours.
The mean volume of distribution was 6@@ 32 l/ m@@ 2@@ ; the large volume of distribution indicates extensive extra@@ vascular distribution and/ or tissue binding of paclitaxel.
In a study in patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of paclitaxel following Abraxane administered intravenously at 260 mg/ m2 over 30 minu@@ tes were compared with those following 1@@ 75 mg/ m2 of the sol@@ vent@@ -@@ based paclitaxel injection administered over 3 hours.
The clearance of paclitaxel with Abraxane was larger (43%) than that following a sol@@ vent@@ -@@ based paclitaxel injection and its volume of distribution was also higher (@@ 5@@ 3%).
Differen@@ c@@ es in Cmax and Cmax corrected for dose ref@@ le@@ c@@ ted differences in total dose and rate of infusion@@ .
There were no differences in ter@@ min@@ al half-@@ li@@ v@@ es.
The protein binding of paclitaxel following Abraxane administration is estimated at about 9@@ 0@@ %.
Based on the p@@ ub@@ lis@@ hed lit@@ erat@@ ure, in vitro studies of binding to human serum protein@@ s, using paclitaxel at concentrations rang@@ ing from 0.@@ 0@@ 3 to 1.@@ 2 µ@@ M@@ , indic@@ ate that about 8@@ 7% of paclitaxel is bo@@ und@@ ; the presence of ran@@ iti@@ d@@ ine, dex@@ a@@ meth@@ as@@ on@@ e, or dip@@ hen@@ hydra@@ min@@ e did not affect protein binding of paclitaxel.
Based on the p@@ ub@@ lis@@ hed lit@@ erat@@ ure, in vitro studies with human liver micro@@ som@@ es and tissue s@@ lic@@ es show that paclitaxel is metabolised primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydrox@@ yp@@ aclitaxel@@ ; and to two min@@ or metabolit@@ es, 3@@ ’ -@@ p@@ -@@ hydrox@@ yp@@ aclitaxel and 6@@ α -@@ 3@@ ’ -@@ p@@ -@@ di@@ hydrox@@ yp@@ aclitaxel.
The formation of these hydroxy@@ lated metabolites is cataly@@ sed by CYP2@@ C@@ 8@@ , -@@ 3A@@ 4, and both -@@ 2C@@ 8 and -@@ 3A4 respectively.
The effect of renal or hepatic dy@@ sf@@ un@@ ction on the disposition of paclitaxel has not been form@@ ally investigated.
In patients with metastatic breast cancer, after a 30 min@@ ute infusion of Abraxane at 260 mg/ m@@ 2@@ , the mean valu@@ e for c@@ umul@@ ative urinary exc@@ retion of unchanged active substance ac@@ co@@ un@@ ted for 4% of the total administered dose with less than 1% as the metabolites 6@@ α -@@ hydrox@@ yp@@ aclitaxel and 3@@ ’ -@@ p@@ -@@ hydrox@@ yp@@ aclitaxel@@ , indicating extensive non-@@ renal cle@@ ar@@ anc@@ e.
Paclitaxel is pr@@ inc@@ ip@@ ally elimin@@ ated by hepatic metabolism and bili@@ ary exc@@ re@@ tion.
Pharmacokineti@@ cs of paclitaxel in patients age@@ d over 65 years se@@ e@@ ms comparable to that in patients less than 65 years.
However, lit@@ t@@ le information in patients over 75 years is available as only 3 patients over 75 years of age where included in the pharmacokinetic analy@@ sis.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
The carcinogenic potential of paclitaxel has not been studi@@ ed.
However, based on the p@@ ub@@ lis@@ hed lit@@ erat@@ ure, paclitaxel is a potentially carcinogenic and geno@@ toxic ag@@ ent at clinical do@@ ses, based upon its pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m of action.
Paclitaxel has been shown to be c@@ la@@ sto@@ gen@@ ic in vitro (@@ ch@@ ro@@ mo@@ some ab@@ er@@ r@@ ations in human lymph@@ ocy@@ te@@ s) and in vivo (@@ micronucleus test in mice).
Paclitaxel has been shown to be geno@@ toxic in vivo (@@ micronucleus test in mic@@ e), but it did not induce mutagenicity
10 in the A@@ mes test or the C@@ hin@@ ese ha@@ m@@ ster o@@ var@@ y@@ / hypo@@ x@@ an@@ th@@ ine-@@ gu@@ an@@ ine phosp@@ h@@ or@@ ib@@ o@@ sy@@ l transferase (@@ CH@@ O@@ / H@@ G@@ PR@@ T@@ ) gene m@@ ut@@ ation ass@@ a@@ y.
Paclitaxel at doses below the human therapeutic dose was associated with low fer@@ tility and foetal toxicity in ra@@ ts.

What is Abseame@@ d?
Abseamed is a solution for injection.
It is available in pre-filled syringes containing between 1,@@ 000 and 1@@ 0,@@ 000 international units (IU) of the active subst@@ ance, epoetin alfa.
Abseamed is a ‘ bio@@ simi@@ lar@@ ’ medicine.
This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological medicine that is al@@ ready author@@ ised in the European Un@@ ion (@@ EU@@ ) and contains the same active substance (@@ also known as the ‘ ref@@ eren@@ ce medicin@@ e@@ ’@@ ).
The ref@@ eren@@ ce medicine for Abseamed is Epre@@ x/ Er@@ y@@ po@@ .
For more information on bio@@ similar medicines, see the ques@@ tion@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ an@@ sw@@ er doc@@ um@@ ent her@@ e.
What is Abseamed used for@@ ?
Abseamed is used in the following situ@@ ations: • to treat anaemia (@@ low red blood cell co@@ un@@ ts@@ ) that is cau@@ sing symptoms in patients with ‘ chronic renal fail@@ ure@@ ’ (@@ lon@@ g@@ -@@ ter@@ m, pro@@ gre@@ s@@ sive decrease in the ability of the kidne@@ ys to wor@@ k proper@@ ly@@ ) or other kidney proble@@ m@@ s; • to treat anaemia in adults receiving chemotherapy for certain types of cancer and to reduce the need for blood transfusion@@ s; • to increase the amount of blood that can be take in adult patients with moderate anaemia who are go@@ ing to have an oper@@ ation and don@@ ate their o@@ wn blood before surgery (@@ autologous blood transfusion@@ ); • to reduce the need for blood transfusions in adults with mild anaemia who are about to under@@ go major orthopaedic (@@ bon@@ e) surgery, such as h@@ ip surgery.
It is used in patients with normal blood iron levels who could experience complications if they were to receive a blood transfusion@@ , if they do not have the op@@ p@@ ort@@ un@@ ity to don@@ ate their o@@ wn blood before surgery and are expected to lose 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml of bloo@@ d.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Abseamed use@@ d?
Treatment with Abseamed must be started under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the management of patients with the conditions that the medicine is used for@@ .
For patients with kidney problems and patients who are go@@ ing to don@@ ate their o@@ wn blood, Abseamed must be injected into a v@@ ein.

The dose, the frequency of injection and how long it is used for de@@ p@@ end on wh@@ y Abseamed is being use@@ d, and are adjusted according to the patient@@ ’ s respon@@ se.
For patients with chronic renal failure or receiving chemotherapy, haemoglobin levels should remain within the recommended range (@@ between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ it@@ re in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl in childr@@ en).
Haemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carrie@@ s oxy@@ gen around the bo@@ dy.
For these patients, the lowest dose that provi@@ des adequate control of symptoms should be used.
The iron levels of all patients should be ch@@ ec@@ k@@ ed before treatment to ma@@ k@@ e sure that they are not too low@@ , and iron supple@@ ments should be used throughout treatment.
For full deta@@ il@@ s, see the Package Leafle@@ t.
How does Abseamed wor@@ k@@ ?
A hormon@@ e called erythropoietin stimulates the production of red blood cells from the bone marro@@ w@@ .
Erythropoietin is produced by the kidne@@ ys.
In patients receiving chemotherapy or with kidney proble@@ ms, anaemia can be cau@@ sed by a lack of erythropoietin, or by the body not responding en@@ ough to the erythropoietin it has nat@@ ur@@ al@@ ly.
In these cases, erythropoietin is used to replac@@ e the mis@@ sing hormon@@ e or to increase red blood cell co@@ un@@ ts.
Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and hel@@ p minimise the con@@ sequ@@ enc@@ es of blood lo@@ s@@ s.
The active substance in Abseame@@ d, epoetin alfa, is a c@@ op@@ y of human erythropoietin and wor@@ ks in ex@@ ac@@ tly the same wa@@ y as the nat@@ u@@ ral hormon@@ e to stimulate red blood cell production.
The epoetin alfa in Abseamed is produced by ‘ recombinant DNA technolog@@ y@@ ’@@ : it is made by a cell that has received a gene (D@@ NA@@ ), which ma@@ k@@ es it able to produce epoetin alfa.
How has Abseamed been studi@@ ed@@ ?
Abseamed was studied to show that it is comparable with the ref@@ eren@@ ce medicin@@ e, Epre@@ x/ Er@@ y@@ po@@ , in experim@@ ent@@ al models and in humans.
Abseame@@ d, injected into a v@@ ein, was compared with the ref@@ eren@@ ce medicine in one main study involving 47@@ 9 patients with anaemia cau@@ sed by kidney proble@@ m@@ s.
All of the patients had been taking Epre@@ x/ Erypo injected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either swit@@ ched to Abseamed or remain@@ ed on Epre@@ x/ Er@@ y@@ po@@ .
The main me@@ as@@ ure of effectiveness was the change in the levels of haemoglobin between the start of the study and the evaluation period, between weeks 25 and 2@@ 9.
The comp@@ any also presen@@ ted the results of a study compar@@ ing the effects of Abseamed injected under the skin with those of Epre@@ x/ Erypo in 1@@ 14 cancer patients who were receiving chemotherapy.
What benefit has Abseamed shown during the studi@@ es@@ ?
Abseamed was as effective as Epre@@ x/ Erypo in increasing and maintaining red blood cell co@@ un@@ ts.
In the study of patients with anaemia cau@@ sed by kidney proble@@ ms, patients swit@@ ching to Abseamed main@@ tained haemoglobin levels to the same extent as those continu@@ ing to take Epre@@ x/ Er@@ y@@ po@@ .
O@@ n a@@ ver@@ age, the levels of the patients taking Abseamed increased by 0.@@ 14@@ 7 g/ dl from a starting valu@@ e of 1@@ 1.@@ 7 g/ dl.
In compar@@ is@@ on, those continu@@ ing to take Epre@@ x/ Erypo had an increase of 0.@@ 06@@ 3 g/ dl from a starting valu@@ e of 12@@ .@@ 0 g/ dl.
The study in patients receiving chemotherapy showed that Abseamed was also as effective as Epre@@ x/ Erypo when it was injected under the skin@@ .
What is the risk associated with Abseame@@ d?
The most common side effect with Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can som@@ eti@@ mes lead to symptoms of encephalopath@@ y (@@ b@@ ra@@ in proble@@ m@@ s) such as sud@@ den, stabbing migraine-like headach@@ e and conf@@ usion@@ .
Abseamed can also lead to skin rash and flu@@ -@@ like symptoms.
For the full list of all side effects reported with Abseame@@ d, see the Package Leafle@@ t.
Abseamed should not be used in people who may be hyper@@ sensi@@ tive (allerg@@ ic@@ ) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredi@@ ents.
It must not be used in the following group@@ s: • patients who have develop@@ ed p@@ ure red cell ap@@ la@@ si@@ a (@@ reduced or stopped red blood cell produc@@ tion@@ ) following treatment with any erythropoietin@@ ; • patients with high blood pressure that is not controlle@@ d; • patients who are go@@ ing to don@@ ate their o@@ wn blood who have had a heart att@@ ack or stroke within the last month, who have angina pector@@ is (@@ a severe type of chest pain@@ ) or who are at risk of deep 2@@ / 3 venous thrombosis (DVT@@ : formation of blood clo@@ ts in the deep v@@ ein@@ s of the bo@@ d@@ y, usually in the le@@ g@@ ); • patients who cannot receive medicines for the prevention of blood clo@@ ts@@ ; • patients about to under@@ go major orthopaedic surgery who have severe cardiovascular (@@ heart and blood ves@@ se@@ l) problems including a recent heart att@@ ack or strok@@ e.
Abseamed is not recommended for injection under the skin in the treatment of kidney problems because further studies are ne@@ e@@ ded to ma@@ k@@ e sure that this does not cause allergic reac@@ tion@@ s.
W@@ h@@ y has Abseamed been appro@@ ve@@ d?
The Com@@ mitte@@ e for Medicinal Produc@@ ts for H@@ uman Use (CHMP) conc@@ lu@@ ded th@@ at, in accordance with E@@ U requirement@@ s, Abseamed has been shown to have a comparable qual@@ ity, safety and efficacy prof@@ ile to Epre@@ x/ Er@@ y@@ po@@ .
The Com@@ mitte@@ e recommended that Abseamed be given marketing authoris@@ ation.
W@@ h@@ ich measures are being taken to ensure the s@@ af@@ e use of Abseame@@ d?
The comp@@ any that ma@@ k@@ es Abseamed will provide information pack@@ s for health@@ care wor@@ k@@ ers in all M@@ emb@@ er St@@ ates, including information on the safety of the medicine.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (C@@ RF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal orig@@ in accomp@@ anied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion require@@ ments in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphom@@ a or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-@@ existing anaemia at the start of chemotherap@@ y).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme@@ .
Its use in this indication must be bal@@ anced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb@@ ) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.@@ 1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency@@ ), if blood sa@@ ving procedu@@ res are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for fe@@ males or 5 or more units for mal@@ es).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to al@@ lo@@ gen@@ ei@@ c blood transfusions in adult non-@@ iron def@@ icient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perc@@ ei@@ ved risk for transfusion complications.
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
2 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration ai@@ med for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provi@@ ded.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose manage@@ ment, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25@@ %.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level@@ .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other causes of anaemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be exclu@@ ded before insti@@ tut@@ ing therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cau@@ ses: iron, fol@@ ate, or vitamin B12 deficiency@@ ; aluminium intoxic@@ ation@@ ; inter@@ current infec@@ tion@@ s; inflamm@@ atory or tra@@ um@@ atic episode@@ s; oc@@ cul@@ t blood loss@@ ; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any orig@@ in.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of at least four weeks.
At each step@@ , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.@@ 75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
3 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achie@@ ved.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
General@@ ly, children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adul@@ ts.
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment:
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usu@@ al maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equ@@ al injection@@ s.
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialy@@ sis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous rou@@ te, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg inc@@ rements (3 times per week@@ ) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four week@@ s).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemi@@ a:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
4 avoide@@ d; gu@@ id@@ ance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values excee@@ ding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following dia@@ gram@@ :
5 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
Tar@@ get Hb (appro@@ x.
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dis@@ continue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl@@ :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50@@ %.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme@@ :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of don@@ ating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedu@@ re.
Mil@@ dly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 - 39@@ %) requiring prede@@ posi@@ t of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.
200 mg oral ele@@ mental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous prede@@ posit@@ , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surger@@ y:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
6 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three weeks (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In cases where there is a medical need to shor@@ ten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 con@@ sec@@ utive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.
When performing haemat@@ olog@@ ic assess@@ ments during the pre@@ operative period, if the haemoglobin level rea@@ ches 15 g/ dl, or high@@ er, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the out@@ set of the treatment patients are not iron def@@ icient.
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron sto@@ res.
Method of administration
Adminis@@ ter the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depen@@ ding on the total dose.
In haemo@@ dialy@@ sed patients, a bol@@ us injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous por@@ t in the dialysis lin@@ e.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistul@@ a needle tub@@ ing, followed by 10 ml of isoton@@ ic sal@@ ine to rin@@ se the tu@@ bing and ensure sati@@ sfac@@ tory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is prefer@@ able in patients who reac@@ t to the treatment with “ flu@@ -like@@ ” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be excee@@ ded.
In case of larger volume@@ s, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injections are given in the th@@ igh@@ s or the anter@@ ior abdominal wall@@ .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutane@@ ous@@ ly@@ !
The intravenous route has to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develo@@ p Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasi@@ a).
Un@@ controlled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous bloo@@ d”@@ : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month pre@@ ce@@ ding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reas@@ on cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylax@@ is.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe cor@@ onar@@ y, peripheral arter@@ ial, car@@ oti@@ d or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident@@ .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inade@@ qu@@ ately treated
It may be necessary to ad@@ d or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This reg@@ resses during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficienc@@ ie@@ s) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optim@@ um response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron stores should be as@@ sure@@ d:
200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally (100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transfer@@ rin sat@@ ur@@ ation is below 20%.
All of these addi@@ tive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when dec@@ iding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practic@@ es should always be used in the per@@ is@@ urg@@ ical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patients develop@@ ing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month@@ ) with increased need for transfusion@@ s, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typ@@ ical causes of non-@@ response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxic@@ ation, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemoly@@ sis@@ ) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ inde@@ x”@@ ) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ mic@@ rolit@@ re or < 0.@@ 5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal@@ , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been fo@@ und, anti-@@ erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examin@@ ation should be considered for dia@@ gno@@ sis of PRC@@ A.
If anti-@@ erythropoietin, anti@@ body-mediated PRCA is suspec@@ ted, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be com@@ men@@ ced because of the risk of cro@@ ss@@ -reaction.
Appro@@ priate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patients
Immun@@ ogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for anti@@ body-@@ induced PRC@@ A, i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not suff@@ icient.
Therefore, in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intraven@@ ously.
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Con@@ trol@@ led clinical trials have not shown significant benefits at@@ trib@@ ut@@ able to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avo@@ id blood transfusion@@ .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
8 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension.
Hyper@@ kalaemia has been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intak@@ e.
Dialy@@ sis prescrip@@ tions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea@@ , creatin@@ ine and potassium in the desired range@@ .
Ser@@ um electroly@@ tes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or ris@@ ing) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ce@@ as@@ ing epoetin alfa administration until hyper@@ kalaemia has been correc@@ ted.
An increase in hep@@ ar@@ in dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occ@@ lu@@ sion of the dialysis system is possible if hep@@ arin@@ isation is not optim@@ um.
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically ev@@ id@@ ent ischaemic heart disease or con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to da@@ te, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accel@@ erate the rate of progression of renal insufficienc@@ y.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appe@@ arance of erythropoiet@@ in-@@ induced red cells should be taken into account when assess@@ ing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transf@@ use@@ d).
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)@@ m, the dose ad@@ ap@@ tation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (T@@ VE@@ s) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8@@ ), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa@@ ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embol@@ is@@ m).
An investig@@ ational study (BES@@ T study@@ ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was de@@ sign@@ ed to determin@@ e whether epoetin alfa treatment that exten@@ ded beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcom@@ es.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In vie@@ w of the abo@@ ve, in some clinical situ@@ ations blood transfusions should be the prefer@@ red treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.
The dec@@ is@@ ion to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benef@@ it@@ -risk assessment with the particip@@ ation of the individual patient@@ , which should also take into account the specific clinical con@@ tex@@ t.
Fac@@ tors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage@@ ; the de@@ gree of anaemi@@ a; life-@@ expec@@ tanc@@ y; the environ@@ ment in which the patient is being trea@@ te@@ d; and patient pre@@ feren@@ ce (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programme@@ s, especially routine volume replace@@ ment, should be respec@@ ted.
9 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thromboti@@ c events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylax@@ is, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special pre@@ caution should be taken in patients with pre@@ disposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT@@ s).
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tum@@ our growth potential
Erythropoietin@@ s are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth fac@@ tors, there is a conc@@ ern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tum@@ ours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have sho@@ wn@@ :
- decreased lo@@ co@@ region@@ al control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.@@ 7 mmol/ l),
- shor@@ ten@@ ed overall survival and increased deaths at@@ tribu@@ ted to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving nei@@ ther chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESA@@ s are not indicated for use in this patient popul@@ ation.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essen@@ tially “ sodi@@ um@@ - fre@@ e”@@ .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alter@@ s the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an inter@@ action.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclo@@ spor@@ in, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit ris@@ es.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differenti@@ ation or prolifer@@ ation of tumour bi@@ op@@ sy spec@@ im@@ ens in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproduc@@ tion toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequent@@ ly:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit out@@ weigh@@ s the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lact@@ ating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
program@@ me, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hyperten@@ sive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur.
At@@ tention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
General
Non-@@ specific skin rash@@ es have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu@@ -like@@ " symptoms such as headach@@ es, joint pain@@ s, feelings of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thromb@@ oc@@ yto@@ sis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thromboti@@ c/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemi@@ a, myocardial infarc@@ tion, cerebrovascular acc@@ id@@ ents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarc@@ tion), transient ischaemic attack@@ s, deep vein thrombosis, arter@@ ial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli@@ , aneurysms, re@@ tinal thrombosis, and clo@@ tting of an ar@@ tif@@ ic@@ ial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythro@@ blastopen@@ ia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed (see sections 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasi@@ a)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressu@@ re: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e. g. headaches and conf@@ used st@@ ate) and gener@@ alised ton@@ oc@@ lon@@ al seizu@@ res, requiring the im@@ mediate attention of a physician and inten@@ sive medical ca@@ re.
Parti@@ cular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migra@@ ine@@ - like headaches as a possible warning signal.
Sh@@ unt thrombo@@ ses may occur, especially in patients who have a ten@@ den@@ cy to hypotension or whose arter@@ io@@ venous fistul@@ ae ex@@ hibit complications (e. g. sten@@ oses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early sh@@ unt revision and thrombosis prophylax@@ is by administration of ac@@ etylsalic@@ ylic acid, for ex@@ amp@@ le, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hyperten@@ sion may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequent@@ ly, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
11 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General@@ ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
Sur@@ ger@@ y patients in autologous predonation program@@ mes
In@@ dependent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotom@@ y.
Therefore, routine volume replace@@ ment should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVT@@ s), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group@@ , although the clinical experience is limit@@ ed.
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic mar@@ gin of epoetin alfa is very wide@@ .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are exten@@ sions of the pharmacological effects of the hormon@@ e.
Phlebotom@@ y may be performed if exces@@ sively high haemoglobin levels occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: anti@@ anaemi@@ c, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glyco@@ protein that stimul@@ ates, as a mito@@ sis-stimulating factor and differenti@@ ating hormon@@ e, the formation of erythrocy@@ tes from pre@@ cur@@ sor@@ s of the stem cell compar@@ tment.
The apparent molec@@ ular weight of erythropoietin is 32,@@ 000 to 40,000 dal@@ ton.
The protein fra@@ ction of the molec@@ ule con@@ tribu@@ tes about 58% and consis@@ ts of 165 amino acid@@ s.
The four carbohydrate chains are attach@@ ed via three N-@@ glycosidic bon@@ ds and one O-@@ glycosidic bond to the protein@@ .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is iden@@ tical in its amino acid and carbohydrate com@@ position to endogen@@ ous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed has the highest possible pur@@ ity according to the pres@@ ent state of the ar@@ t.
In particul@@ ar, no resi@@ du@@ es of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, poly@@ cy@@ th@@ aemi@@ c mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocy@@ tes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59@@ Fe-@@ incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-@@ thy@@ mid@@ ine incorporation in the erythro@@ id nucle@@ ated spleen cells has been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell cultu@@ re) after inc@@ ubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultu@@ res of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leu@@ co@@ po@@ ie@@ sis.
Cyto@@ toxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detec@@ ted.
12 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-@@ Hodgkin@@ 's lymphom@@ a, and 24 other haematological malignancie@@ s) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 pro@@ state, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour typ@@ es).
In two lar@@ ge, open-label studies, 26@@ 97 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were include@@ d, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour typ@@ es) and 802 with haematological malignancie@@ s.
In a pro@@ spec@@ tiv@@ e, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-@@ myelo@@ id malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemi@@ a-related sequelae (e. g. fatigu@@ e, decreased energy, and activity reduc@@ tion), as measured by the following instrum@@ ents and scal@@ es:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therap@@ y- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other sm@@ all@@ er, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in qual@@ ity of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLA@@ S, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examin@@ ed in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blin@@ d placebo-controlled studies and one was an open@@ - label study.
The studies either rec@@ ru@@ it@@ ed patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studi@@ es) or used patient popul@@ ations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indic@@ ate@@ d: anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radio@@ therapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl@@ ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratio@@ s for overall survival range@@ d between 1.@@ 25 and 2.@@ 47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown an consis@@ tent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common canc@@ ers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Over@@ all survival out@@ come in the trials could not be stati@@ sfac@@ tor@@ ily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A system@@ atic revie@@ w has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials.
Met@@ a-@@ analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point esti@@ mate of 1.@@ 08 in favour of control@@ s (95% CI:
0.@@ 99@@ , 1,18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.@@ 67@@ , 95% CI:
1.@@ 35@@ , 2.@@ 06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin@@ .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcom@@ es might app@@ ly to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is uncle@@ ar because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data revie@@ we@@ d.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Intravenous route
Me@@ asure@@ ment of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volun@@ te@@ ers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
13 18 hours post@@ dose.
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20@@ th of the valu@@ e).
There is no accumul@@ ation: the levels remain the sa@@ me, whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection.
The half-life is diff@@ ic@@ ult to evalu@@ ate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some pre@@ clinical toxic@@ ological studies in do@@ gs and rats, but not in monke@@ ys, epoetin alfa therapy was associated with sub@@ clinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyper@@ parathy@@ ro@@ idis@@ m or unknown fac@@ tors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a mat@@ ched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa@@ .).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.
These changes are inter@@ pre@@ ted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacter@@ ial and ma@@ mm@@ al@@ ian cell cul@@ ture mutagenicity te@@ sts and an in vivo micronucleus test in mic@@ e.
Lon@@ g-term carcin@@ ogenicity studies have not been carried ou@@ t.
There are conf@@ lic@@ ting reports in the lit@@ erature reg@@ ar@@ ding whether erythropoietins may pla@@ y a major role as tumour prolifer@@ ator@@ s.
These reports are based on in vitro find@@ ings from human tumour samp@@ les, but are of unc@@ ertain significance in the clinical situ@@ ation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (C@@ RF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal orig@@ in accomp@@ anied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion require@@ ments in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphom@@ a or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-@@ existing anaemia at the start of chemotherap@@ y).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme@@ .
Its use in this indication must be bal@@ anced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb@@ ) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.@@ 1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency@@ ), if blood sa@@ ving procedu@@ res are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for fe@@ males or 5 or more units for mal@@ es).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to al@@ lo@@ gen@@ ei@@ c blood transfusions in adult non-@@ iron def@@ icient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perc@@ ei@@ ved risk for transfusion complications.
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initi@@ ated under the supervision of physici@@ ans experienced in the management of patients with the above indic@@ ations.
16 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration ai@@ med for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provi@@ ded.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose manage@@ ment, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25@@ %.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level@@ .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other causes of anaemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be exclu@@ ded before insti@@ tut@@ ing therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cau@@ ses: iron, fol@@ ate, or vitamin B12 deficiency@@ ; aluminium intoxic@@ ation@@ ; inter@@ current infec@@ tion@@ s; inflamm@@ atory or tra@@ um@@ atic episode@@ s; oc@@ cul@@ t blood loss@@ ; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any orig@@ in.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of at least four weeks.
At each step@@ , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.@@ 75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
17 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achie@@ ved.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
General@@ ly, children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adul@@ ts.
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment:
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usu@@ al maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equ@@ al injection@@ s.
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialy@@ sis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous rou@@ te, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg inc@@ rements (3 times per week@@ ) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four week@@ s).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemi@@ a:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
18 avoide@@ d; gu@@ id@@ ance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values excee@@ ding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following dia@@ gram@@ :
19 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
Tar@@ get Hb (appro@@ x.
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dis@@ continue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl@@ :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50@@ %.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme@@ :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of don@@ ating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedu@@ re.
Mil@@ dly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 - 39@@ %) requiring prede@@ posi@@ t of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.
200 mg oral ele@@ mental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous prede@@ posit@@ , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surger@@ y:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
20 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three weeks (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In cases where there is a medical need to shor@@ ten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 con@@ sec@@ utive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.
When performing haemat@@ olog@@ ic assess@@ ments during the pre@@ operative period, if the haemoglobin level rea@@ ches 15 g/ dl, or high@@ er, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the out@@ set of the treatment patients are not iron def@@ icient.
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron sto@@ res.
Method of administration
Adminis@@ ter the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depen@@ ding on the total dose.
In haemo@@ dialy@@ sed patients, a bol@@ us injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous por@@ t in the dialysis lin@@ e.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistul@@ a needle tub@@ ing, followed by 10 ml of isoton@@ ic sal@@ ine to rin@@ se the tu@@ bing and ensure sati@@ sfac@@ tory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is prefer@@ able in patients who reac@@ t to the treatment with “ flu@@ -like@@ ” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be excee@@ ded.
In case of larger volume@@ s, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injections are given in the th@@ igh@@ s or the anter@@ ior abdominal wall@@ .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutane@@ ous@@ ly@@ !
The intravenous route has to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develo@@ p Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasi@@ a).
Un@@ controlled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous bloo@@ d”@@ : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month pre@@ ce@@ ding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reas@@ on cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylax@@ is.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe cor@@ onar@@ y, peripheral arter@@ ial, car@@ oti@@ d or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident@@ .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inade@@ qu@@ ately treated
It may be necessary to ad@@ d or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This reg@@ resses during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficienc@@ ie@@ s) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optim@@ um response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron stores should be as@@ sure@@ d:
200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally (100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transfer@@ rin sat@@ ur@@ ation is below 20%.
All of these addi@@ tive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when dec@@ iding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practic@@ es should always be used in the per@@ is@@ urg@@ ical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patients develop@@ ing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month@@ ) with increased need for transfusion@@ s, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typ@@ ical causes of non-@@ response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxic@@ ation, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemoly@@ sis@@ ) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ inde@@ x”@@ ) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ mic@@ rolit@@ re or < 0.@@ 5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal@@ , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been fo@@ und, anti-@@ erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examin@@ ation should be considered for dia@@ gno@@ sis of PRC@@ A.
If anti-@@ erythropoietin, anti@@ body-mediated PRCA is suspec@@ ted, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be com@@ men@@ ced because of the risk of cro@@ ss@@ -reaction.
Appro@@ priate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patients
Immun@@ ogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for anti@@ body-@@ induced PRC@@ A, i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not suff@@ icient.
Therefore, in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intraven@@ ously.
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Con@@ trol@@ led clinical trials have not shown significant benefits at@@ trib@@ ut@@ able to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avo@@ id blood transfusion@@ .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
22 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension.
Hyper@@ kalaemia has been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intak@@ e.
Dialy@@ sis prescrip@@ tions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea@@ , creatin@@ ine and potassium in the desired range@@ .
Ser@@ um electroly@@ tes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or ris@@ ing) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ce@@ as@@ ing epoetin alfa administration until hyper@@ kalaemia has been correc@@ ted.
An increase in hep@@ ar@@ in dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occ@@ lu@@ sion of the dialysis system is possible if hep@@ arin@@ isation is not optim@@ um.
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically ev@@ id@@ ent ischaemic heart disease or con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to da@@ te, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accel@@ erate the rate of progression of renal insufficienc@@ y.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appe@@ arance of erythropoiet@@ in-@@ induced red cells should be taken into account when assess@@ ing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transf@@ use@@ d).
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)@@ m, the dose ad@@ ap@@ tation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (T@@ VE@@ s) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8@@ ), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa@@ ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embol@@ is@@ m).
An investig@@ ational study (BES@@ T study@@ ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was de@@ sign@@ ed to determin@@ e whether epoetin alfa treatment that exten@@ ded beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcom@@ es.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In vie@@ w of the abo@@ ve, in some clinical situ@@ ations blood transfusions should be the prefer@@ red treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.
The dec@@ is@@ ion to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benef@@ it@@ -risk assessment with the particip@@ ation of the individual patient@@ , which should also take into account the specific clinical con@@ tex@@ t.
Fac@@ tors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage@@ ; the de@@ gree of anaemi@@ a; life-@@ expec@@ tanc@@ y; the environ@@ ment in which the patient is being trea@@ te@@ d; and patient pre@@ feren@@ ce (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programme@@ s, especially routine volume replace@@ ment, should be respec@@ ted.
23 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thromboti@@ c events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylax@@ is, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special pre@@ caution should be taken in patients with pre@@ disposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT@@ s).
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tum@@ our growth potential
Erythropoietin@@ s are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth fac@@ tors, there is a conc@@ ern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tum@@ ours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have sho@@ wn@@ :
- decreased lo@@ co@@ region@@ al control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.@@ 7 mmol/ l),
- shor@@ ten@@ ed overall survival and increased deaths at@@ tribu@@ ted to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving nei@@ ther chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESA@@ s are not indicated for use in this patient popul@@ ation.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essen@@ tially “ sodi@@ um@@ - fre@@ e”@@ .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alter@@ s the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an inter@@ action.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclo@@ spor@@ in, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit ris@@ es.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differenti@@ ation or prolifer@@ ation of tumour bi@@ op@@ sy spec@@ im@@ ens in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproduc@@ tion toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequent@@ ly:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit out@@ weigh@@ s the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lact@@ ating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
program@@ me, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hyperten@@ sive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur.
At@@ tention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
General
Non-@@ specific skin rash@@ es have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu@@ -like@@ " symptoms such as headach@@ es, joint pain@@ s, feelings of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thromb@@ oc@@ yto@@ sis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thromboti@@ c/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemi@@ a, myocardial infarc@@ tion, cerebrovascular acc@@ id@@ ents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarc@@ tion), transient ischaemic attack@@ s, deep vein thrombosis, arter@@ ial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli@@ , aneurysms, re@@ tinal thrombosis, and clo@@ tting of an ar@@ tif@@ ic@@ ial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythro@@ blastopen@@ ia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed (see sections 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasi@@ a)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressu@@ re: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e. g. headaches and conf@@ used st@@ ate) and gener@@ alised ton@@ oc@@ lon@@ al seizu@@ res, requiring the im@@ mediate attention of a physician and inten@@ sive medical ca@@ re.
Parti@@ cular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migra@@ ine@@ - like headaches as a possible warning signal.
Sh@@ unt thrombo@@ ses may occur, especially in patients who have a ten@@ den@@ cy to hypotension or whose arter@@ io@@ venous fistul@@ ae ex@@ hibit complications (e. g. sten@@ oses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early sh@@ unt revision and thrombosis prophylax@@ is by administration of ac@@ etylsalic@@ ylic acid, for ex@@ amp@@ le, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hyperten@@ sion may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequent@@ ly, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
25 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General@@ ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
Sur@@ ger@@ y patients in autologous predonation program@@ mes
In@@ dependent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotom@@ y.
Therefore, routine volume replace@@ ment should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVT@@ s), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group@@ , although the clinical experience is limit@@ ed.
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic mar@@ gin of epoetin alfa is very wide@@ .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are exten@@ sions of the pharmacological effects of the hormon@@ e.
Phlebotom@@ y may be performed if exces@@ sively high haemoglobin levels occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: anti@@ anaemi@@ c, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glyco@@ protein that stimul@@ ates, as a mito@@ sis-stimulating factor and differenti@@ ating hormon@@ e, the formation of erythrocy@@ tes from pre@@ cur@@ sor@@ s of the stem cell compar@@ tment.
The apparent molec@@ ular weight of erythropoietin is 32,@@ 000 to 40,000 dal@@ ton.
The protein fra@@ ction of the molec@@ ule con@@ tribu@@ tes about 58% and consis@@ ts of 165 amino acid@@ s.
The four carbohydrate chains are attach@@ ed via three N-@@ glycosidic bon@@ ds and one O-@@ glycosidic bond to the protein@@ .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is iden@@ tical in its amino acid and carbohydrate com@@ position to endogen@@ ous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed has the highest possible pur@@ ity according to the pres@@ ent state of the ar@@ t.
In particul@@ ar, no resi@@ du@@ es of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, poly@@ cy@@ th@@ aemi@@ c mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocy@@ tes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59@@ Fe-@@ incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-@@ thy@@ mid@@ ine incorporation in the erythro@@ id nucle@@ ated spleen cells has been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell cultu@@ re) after inc@@ ubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultu@@ res of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leu@@ co@@ po@@ ie@@ sis.
Cyto@@ toxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detec@@ ted.
26 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-@@ Hodgkin@@ 's lymphom@@ a, and 24 other haematological malignancie@@ s) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 pro@@ state, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour typ@@ es).
In two lar@@ ge, open-label studies, 26@@ 97 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were include@@ d, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour typ@@ es) and 802 with haematological malignancie@@ s.
In a pro@@ spec@@ tiv@@ e, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-@@ myelo@@ id malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemi@@ a-related sequelae (e. g. fatigu@@ e, decreased energy, and activity reduc@@ tion), as measured by the following instrum@@ ents and scal@@ es:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therap@@ y- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other sm@@ all@@ er, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in qual@@ ity of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLA@@ S, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examin@@ ed in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blin@@ d placebo-controlled studies and one was an open@@ - label study.
The studies either rec@@ ru@@ it@@ ed patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studi@@ es) or used patient popul@@ ations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indic@@ ate@@ d: anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radio@@ therapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl@@ ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratio@@ s for overall survival range@@ d between 1.@@ 25 and 2.@@ 47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown an consis@@ tent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common canc@@ ers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Over@@ all survival out@@ come in the trials could not be stati@@ sfac@@ tor@@ ily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A system@@ atic revie@@ w has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials.
Met@@ a-@@ analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point esti@@ mate of 1.@@ 08 in favour of control@@ s (95% CI:
0.@@ 99@@ , 1,18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.@@ 67@@ , 95% CI:
1.@@ 35@@ , 2.@@ 06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin@@ .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcom@@ es might app@@ ly to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is uncle@@ ar because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data revie@@ we@@ d.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Intravenous route
Me@@ asure@@ ment of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volun@@ te@@ ers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
27 18 hours post@@ dose.
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20@@ th of the valu@@ e).
There is no accumul@@ ation: the levels remain the sa@@ me, whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection.
The half-life is diff@@ ic@@ ult to evalu@@ ate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some pre@@ clinical toxic@@ ological studies in do@@ gs and rats, but not in monke@@ ys, epoetin alfa therapy was associated with sub@@ clinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyper@@ parathy@@ ro@@ idis@@ m or unknown fac@@ tors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a mat@@ ched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa@@ .).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.
These changes are inter@@ pre@@ ted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacter@@ ial and ma@@ mm@@ al@@ ian cell cul@@ ture mutagenicity te@@ sts and an in vivo micronucleus test in mic@@ e.
Lon@@ g-term carcin@@ ogenicity studies have not been carried ou@@ t.
There are conf@@ lic@@ ting reports in the lit@@ erature reg@@ ar@@ ding whether erythropoietins may pla@@ y a major role as tumour prolifer@@ ator@@ s.
These reports are based on in vitro find@@ ings from human tumour samp@@ les, but are of unc@@ ertain significance in the clinical situ@@ ation.

- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal orig@@ in accomp@@ anied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion require@@ ments in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphom@@ a or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-@@ existing anaemia at the start of chemotherap@@ y).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme@@ .
Its use in this indication must be bal@@ anced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb@@ ) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.@@ 1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency@@ ), if blood sa@@ ving procedu@@ res are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for fe@@ males or 5 or more units for mal@@ es).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to al@@ lo@@ gen@@ ei@@ c blood transfusions in adult non-@@ iron def@@ icient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perc@@ ei@@ ved risk for transfusion complications.
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initi@@ ated under the supervision of physici@@ ans experienced in the management of patients with the above indic@@ ations.
30 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration ai@@ med for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provi@@ ded.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose manage@@ ment, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25@@ %.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level@@ .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other causes of anaemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be exclu@@ ded before insti@@ tut@@ ing therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cau@@ ses: iron, fol@@ ate, or vitamin B12 deficiency@@ ; aluminium intoxic@@ ation@@ ; inter@@ current infec@@ tion@@ s; inflamm@@ atory or tra@@ um@@ atic episode@@ s; oc@@ cul@@ t blood loss@@ ; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any orig@@ in.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of at least four weeks.
At each step@@ , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.@@ 75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
31 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achie@@ ved.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
General@@ ly, children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adul@@ ts.
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment:
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usu@@ al maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equ@@ al injection@@ s.
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialy@@ sis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous rou@@ te, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg inc@@ rements (3 times per week@@ ) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four week@@ s).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemi@@ a:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
32 avoide@@ d; gu@@ id@@ ance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values excee@@ ding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following dia@@ gram@@ :
33 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
Tar@@ get Hb (appro@@ x.
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dis@@ continue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl@@ :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50@@ %.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme@@ :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of don@@ ating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedu@@ re.
Mil@@ dly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 - 39@@ %) requiring prede@@ posi@@ t of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.
200 mg oral ele@@ mental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous prede@@ posit@@ , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surger@@ y:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
34 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three weeks (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In cases where there is a medical need to shor@@ ten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 con@@ sec@@ utive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.
When performing haemat@@ olog@@ ic assess@@ ments during the pre@@ operative period, if the haemoglobin level rea@@ ches 15 g/ dl, or high@@ er, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the out@@ set of the treatment patients are not iron def@@ icient.
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron sto@@ res.
Method of administration
Adminis@@ ter the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depen@@ ding on the total dose.
In haemo@@ dialy@@ sed patients, a bol@@ us injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous por@@ t in the dialysis lin@@ e.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistul@@ a needle tub@@ ing, followed by 10 ml of isoton@@ ic sal@@ ine to rin@@ se the tu@@ bing and ensure sati@@ sfac@@ tory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is prefer@@ able in patients who reac@@ t to the treatment with “ flu@@ -like@@ ” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be excee@@ ded.
In case of larger volume@@ s, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injections are given in the th@@ igh@@ s or the anter@@ ior abdominal wall@@ .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutane@@ ous@@ ly@@ !
The intravenous route has to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develo@@ p Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasi@@ a).
Un@@ controlled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous bloo@@ d”@@ : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month pre@@ ce@@ ding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reas@@ on cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylax@@ is.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe cor@@ onar@@ y, peripheral arter@@ ial, car@@ oti@@ d or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident@@ .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inade@@ qu@@ ately treated
It may be necessary to ad@@ d or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This reg@@ resses during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficienc@@ ie@@ s) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optim@@ um response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron stores should be as@@ sure@@ d:
200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally (100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transfer@@ rin sat@@ ur@@ ation is below 20%.
All of these addi@@ tive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when dec@@ iding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practic@@ es should always be used in the per@@ is@@ urg@@ ical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patients develop@@ ing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month@@ ) with increased need for transfusion@@ s, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typ@@ ical causes of non-@@ response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxic@@ ation, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemoly@@ sis@@ ) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ inde@@ x”@@ ) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ mic@@ rolit@@ re or < 0.@@ 5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal@@ , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been fo@@ und, anti-@@ erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examin@@ ation should be considered for dia@@ gno@@ sis of PRC@@ A.
If anti-@@ erythropoietin, anti@@ body-mediated PRCA is suspec@@ ted, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be com@@ men@@ ced because of the risk of cro@@ ss@@ -reaction.
Appro@@ priate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patients
Immun@@ ogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for anti@@ body-@@ induced PRC@@ A, i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not suff@@ icient.
Therefore, in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intraven@@ ously.
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Con@@ trol@@ led clinical trials have not shown significant benefits at@@ trib@@ ut@@ able to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avo@@ id blood transfusion@@ .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
36 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension.
Hyper@@ kalaemia has been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intak@@ e.
Dialy@@ sis prescrip@@ tions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea@@ , creatin@@ ine and potassium in the desired range@@ .
Ser@@ um electroly@@ tes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or ris@@ ing) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ce@@ as@@ ing epoetin alfa administration until hyper@@ kalaemia has been correc@@ ted.
An increase in hep@@ ar@@ in dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occ@@ lu@@ sion of the dialysis system is possible if hep@@ arin@@ isation is not optim@@ um.
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically ev@@ id@@ ent ischaemic heart disease or con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to da@@ te, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accel@@ erate the rate of progression of renal insufficienc@@ y.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appe@@ arance of erythropoiet@@ in-@@ induced red cells should be taken into account when assess@@ ing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transf@@ use@@ d).
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)@@ m, the dose ad@@ ap@@ tation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (T@@ VE@@ s) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8@@ ), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa@@ ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embol@@ is@@ m).
An investig@@ ational study (BES@@ T study@@ ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was de@@ sign@@ ed to determin@@ e whether epoetin alfa treatment that exten@@ ded beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcom@@ es.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In vie@@ w of the abo@@ ve, in some clinical situ@@ ations blood transfusions should be the prefer@@ red treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.
The dec@@ is@@ ion to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benef@@ it@@ -risk assessment with the particip@@ ation of the individual patient@@ , which should also take into account the specific clinical con@@ tex@@ t.
Fac@@ tors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage@@ ; the de@@ gree of anaemi@@ a; life-@@ expec@@ tanc@@ y; the environ@@ ment in which the patient is being trea@@ te@@ d; and patient pre@@ feren@@ ce (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programme@@ s, especially routine volume replace@@ ment, should be respec@@ ted.
37 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thromboti@@ c events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylax@@ is, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special pre@@ caution should be taken in patients with pre@@ disposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT@@ s).
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tum@@ our growth potential
Erythropoietin@@ s are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth fac@@ tors, there is a conc@@ ern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tum@@ ours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have sho@@ wn@@ :
- decreased lo@@ co@@ region@@ al control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.@@ 7 mmol/ l),
- shor@@ ten@@ ed overall survival and increased deaths at@@ tribu@@ ted to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving nei@@ ther chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESA@@ s are not indicated for use in this patient popul@@ ation.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essen@@ tially “ sodi@@ um@@ - fre@@ e”@@ .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alter@@ s the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an inter@@ action.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclo@@ spor@@ in, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit ris@@ es.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differenti@@ ation or prolifer@@ ation of tumour bi@@ op@@ sy spec@@ im@@ ens in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproduc@@ tion toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequent@@ ly:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit out@@ weigh@@ s the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lact@@ ating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
program@@ me, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hyperten@@ sive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur.
At@@ tention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
General
Non-@@ specific skin rash@@ es have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu@@ -like@@ " symptoms such as headach@@ es, joint pain@@ s, feelings of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thromb@@ oc@@ yto@@ sis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thromboti@@ c/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemi@@ a, myocardial infarc@@ tion, cerebrovascular acc@@ id@@ ents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarc@@ tion), transient ischaemic attack@@ s, deep vein thrombosis, arter@@ ial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli@@ , aneurysms, re@@ tinal thrombosis, and clo@@ tting of an ar@@ tif@@ ic@@ ial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythro@@ blastopen@@ ia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed (see sections 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasi@@ a)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressu@@ re: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e. g. headaches and conf@@ used st@@ ate) and gener@@ alised ton@@ oc@@ lon@@ al seizu@@ res, requiring the im@@ mediate attention of a physician and inten@@ sive medical ca@@ re.
Parti@@ cular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migra@@ ine@@ - like headaches as a possible warning signal.
Sh@@ unt thrombo@@ ses may occur, especially in patients who have a ten@@ den@@ cy to hypotension or whose arter@@ io@@ venous fistul@@ ae ex@@ hibit complications (e. g. sten@@ oses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early sh@@ unt revision and thrombosis prophylax@@ is by administration of ac@@ etylsalic@@ ylic acid, for ex@@ amp@@ le, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hyperten@@ sion may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequent@@ ly, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
39 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General@@ ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
Sur@@ ger@@ y patients in autologous predonation program@@ mes
In@@ dependent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotom@@ y.
Therefore, routine volume replace@@ ment should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVT@@ s), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group@@ , although the clinical experience is limit@@ ed.
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic mar@@ gin of epoetin alfa is very wide@@ .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are exten@@ sions of the pharmacological effects of the hormon@@ e.
Phlebotom@@ y may be performed if exces@@ sively high haemoglobin levels occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: anti@@ anaemi@@ c, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glyco@@ protein that stimul@@ ates, as a mito@@ sis-stimulating factor and differenti@@ ating hormon@@ e, the formation of erythrocy@@ tes from pre@@ cur@@ sor@@ s of the stem cell compar@@ tment.
The apparent molec@@ ular weight of erythropoietin is 32,@@ 000 to 40,000 dal@@ ton.
The protein fra@@ ction of the molec@@ ule con@@ tribu@@ tes about 58% and consis@@ ts of 165 amino acid@@ s.
The four carbohydrate chains are attach@@ ed via three N-@@ glycosidic bon@@ ds and one O-@@ glycosidic bond to the protein@@ .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is iden@@ tical in its amino acid and carbohydrate com@@ position to endogen@@ ous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed has the highest possible pur@@ ity according to the pres@@ ent state of the ar@@ t.
In particul@@ ar, no resi@@ du@@ es of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, poly@@ cy@@ th@@ aemi@@ c mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocy@@ tes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59@@ Fe-@@ incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-@@ thy@@ mid@@ ine incorporation in the erythro@@ id nucle@@ ated spleen cells has been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell cultu@@ re) after inc@@ ubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultu@@ res of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leu@@ co@@ po@@ ie@@ sis.
Cyto@@ toxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detec@@ ted.
40 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-@@ Hodgkin@@ 's lymphom@@ a, and 24 other haematological malignancie@@ s) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 pro@@ state, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour typ@@ es).
In two lar@@ ge, open-label studies, 26@@ 97 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were include@@ d, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour typ@@ es) and 802 with haematological malignancie@@ s.
In a pro@@ spec@@ tiv@@ e, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-@@ myelo@@ id malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemi@@ a-related sequelae (e. g. fatigu@@ e, decreased energy, and activity reduc@@ tion), as measured by the following instrum@@ ents and scal@@ es:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therap@@ y- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other sm@@ all@@ er, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in qual@@ ity of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLA@@ S, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examin@@ ed in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blin@@ d placebo-controlled studies and one was an open@@ - label study.
The studies either rec@@ ru@@ it@@ ed patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studi@@ es) or used patient popul@@ ations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indic@@ ate@@ d: anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radio@@ therapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl@@ ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratio@@ s for overall survival range@@ d between 1.@@ 25 and 2.@@ 47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown an consis@@ tent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common canc@@ ers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Over@@ all survival out@@ come in the trials could not be stati@@ sfac@@ tor@@ ily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A system@@ atic revie@@ w has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials.
Met@@ a-@@ analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point esti@@ mate of 1.@@ 08 in favour of control@@ s (95% CI:
0.@@ 99@@ , 1,18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.@@ 67@@ , 95% CI:
1.@@ 35@@ , 2.@@ 06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin@@ .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcom@@ es might app@@ ly to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is uncle@@ ar because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data revie@@ we@@ d.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Intravenous route
Me@@ asure@@ ment of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volun@@ te@@ ers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
4@@ 1 18 hours post@@ dose.
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20@@ th of the valu@@ e).
There is no accumul@@ ation: the levels remain the sa@@ me, whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection.
The half-life is diff@@ ic@@ ult to evalu@@ ate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some pre@@ clinical toxic@@ ological studies in do@@ gs and rats, but not in monke@@ ys, epoetin alfa therapy was associated with sub@@ clinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyper@@ parathy@@ ro@@ idis@@ m or unknown fac@@ tors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a mat@@ ched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa@@ .).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.
These changes are inter@@ pre@@ ted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacter@@ ial and ma@@ mm@@ al@@ ian cell cul@@ ture mutagenicity te@@ sts and an in vivo micronucleus test in mic@@ e.
Lon@@ g-term carcin@@ ogenicity studies have not been carried ou@@ t.
There are conf@@ lic@@ ting reports in the lit@@ erature reg@@ ar@@ ding whether erythropoietins may pla@@ y a major role as tumour prolifer@@ ator@@ s.
These reports are based on in vitro find@@ ings from human tumour samp@@ les, but are of unc@@ ertain significance in the clinical situ@@ ation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (C@@ RF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal orig@@ in accomp@@ anied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion require@@ ments in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphom@@ a or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-@@ existing anaemia at the start of chemotherap@@ y).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme@@ .
Its use in this indication must be bal@@ anced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb@@ ) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.@@ 1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency@@ ), if blood sa@@ ving procedu@@ res are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for fe@@ males or 5 or more units for mal@@ es).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to al@@ lo@@ gen@@ ei@@ c blood transfusions in adult non-@@ iron def@@ icient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perc@@ ei@@ ved risk for transfusion complications.
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initi@@ ated under the supervision of physici@@ ans experienced in the management of patients with the above indic@@ ations.
44 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration ai@@ med for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provi@@ ded.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose manage@@ ment, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25@@ %.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level@@ .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other causes of anaemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be exclu@@ ded before insti@@ tut@@ ing therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cau@@ ses: iron, fol@@ ate, or vitamin B12 deficiency@@ ; aluminium intoxic@@ ation@@ ; inter@@ current infec@@ tion@@ s; inflamm@@ atory or tra@@ um@@ atic episode@@ s; oc@@ cul@@ t blood loss@@ ; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any orig@@ in.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of at least four weeks.
At each step@@ , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.@@ 75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
45 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achie@@ ved.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
General@@ ly, children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adul@@ ts.
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment:
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usu@@ al maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equ@@ al injection@@ s.
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialy@@ sis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous rou@@ te, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg inc@@ rements (3 times per week@@ ) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four week@@ s).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemi@@ a:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
46 avoide@@ d; gu@@ id@@ ance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values excee@@ ding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following dia@@ gram@@ :
47 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
Tar@@ get Hb (appro@@ x.
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dis@@ continue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl@@ :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50@@ %.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme@@ :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of don@@ ating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedu@@ re.
Mil@@ dly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 - 39@@ %) requiring prede@@ posi@@ t of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.
200 mg oral ele@@ mental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous prede@@ posit@@ , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surger@@ y:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
48 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three weeks (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In cases where there is a medical need to shor@@ ten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 con@@ sec@@ utive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.
When performing haemat@@ olog@@ ic assess@@ ments during the pre@@ operative period, if the haemoglobin level rea@@ ches 15 g/ dl, or high@@ er, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the out@@ set of the treatment patients are not iron def@@ icient.
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron sto@@ res.
Method of administration
Adminis@@ ter the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depen@@ ding on the total dose.
In haemo@@ dialy@@ sed patients, a bol@@ us injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous por@@ t in the dialysis lin@@ e.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistul@@ a needle tub@@ ing, followed by 10 ml of isoton@@ ic sal@@ ine to rin@@ se the tu@@ bing and ensure sati@@ sfac@@ tory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is prefer@@ able in patients who reac@@ t to the treatment with “ flu@@ -like@@ ” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be excee@@ ded.
In case of larger volume@@ s, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injections are given in the th@@ igh@@ s or the anter@@ ior abdominal wall@@ .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutane@@ ous@@ ly@@ !
The intravenous route has to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develo@@ p Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasi@@ a).
Un@@ controlled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous bloo@@ d”@@ : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month pre@@ ce@@ ding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reas@@ on cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylax@@ is.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe cor@@ onar@@ y, peripheral arter@@ ial, car@@ oti@@ d or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident@@ .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inade@@ qu@@ ately treated
It may be necessary to ad@@ d or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This reg@@ resses during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficienc@@ ie@@ s) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optim@@ um response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron stores should be as@@ sure@@ d:
200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally (100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transfer@@ rin sat@@ ur@@ ation is below 20%.
All of these addi@@ tive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when dec@@ iding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practic@@ es should always be used in the per@@ is@@ urg@@ ical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patients develop@@ ing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month@@ ) with increased need for transfusion@@ s, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typ@@ ical causes of non-@@ response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxic@@ ation, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemoly@@ sis@@ ) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ inde@@ x”@@ ) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ mic@@ rolit@@ re or < 0.@@ 5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal@@ , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been fo@@ und, anti-@@ erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examin@@ ation should be considered for dia@@ gno@@ sis of PRC@@ A.
If anti-@@ erythropoietin, anti@@ body-mediated PRCA is suspec@@ ted, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be com@@ men@@ ced because of the risk of cro@@ ss@@ -reaction.
Appro@@ priate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patients
Immun@@ ogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for anti@@ body-@@ induced PRC@@ A, i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not suff@@ icient.
Therefore, in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intraven@@ ously.
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Con@@ trol@@ led clinical trials have not shown significant benefits at@@ trib@@ ut@@ able to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avo@@ id blood transfusion@@ .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
50 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension.
Hyper@@ kalaemia has been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intak@@ e.
Dialy@@ sis prescrip@@ tions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea@@ , creatin@@ ine and potassium in the desired range@@ .
Ser@@ um electroly@@ tes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or ris@@ ing) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ce@@ as@@ ing epoetin alfa administration until hyper@@ kalaemia has been correc@@ ted.
An increase in hep@@ ar@@ in dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occ@@ lu@@ sion of the dialysis system is possible if hep@@ arin@@ isation is not optim@@ um.
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically ev@@ id@@ ent ischaemic heart disease or con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to da@@ te, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accel@@ erate the rate of progression of renal insufficienc@@ y.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appe@@ arance of erythropoiet@@ in-@@ induced red cells should be taken into account when assess@@ ing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transf@@ use@@ d).
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)@@ m, the dose ad@@ ap@@ tation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (T@@ VE@@ s) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8@@ ), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa@@ ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embol@@ is@@ m).
An investig@@ ational study (BES@@ T study@@ ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was de@@ sign@@ ed to determin@@ e whether epoetin alfa treatment that exten@@ ded beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcom@@ es.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In vie@@ w of the abo@@ ve, in some clinical situ@@ ations blood transfusions should be the prefer@@ red treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.
The dec@@ is@@ ion to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benef@@ it@@ -risk assessment with the particip@@ ation of the individual patient@@ , which should also take into account the specific clinical con@@ tex@@ t.
Fac@@ tors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage@@ ; the de@@ gree of anaemi@@ a; life-@@ expec@@ tanc@@ y; the environ@@ ment in which the patient is being trea@@ te@@ d; and patient pre@@ feren@@ ce (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programme@@ s, especially routine volume replace@@ ment, should be respec@@ ted.
5@@ 1 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thromboti@@ c events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylax@@ is, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special pre@@ caution should be taken in patients with pre@@ disposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT@@ s).
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tum@@ our growth potential
Erythropoietin@@ s are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth fac@@ tors, there is a conc@@ ern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tum@@ ours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have sho@@ wn@@ :
- decreased lo@@ co@@ region@@ al control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.@@ 7 mmol/ l),
- shor@@ ten@@ ed overall survival and increased deaths at@@ tribu@@ ted to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving nei@@ ther chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESA@@ s are not indicated for use in this patient popul@@ ation.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essen@@ tially “ sodi@@ um@@ - fre@@ e”@@ .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alter@@ s the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an inter@@ action.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclo@@ spor@@ in, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit ris@@ es.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differenti@@ ation or prolifer@@ ation of tumour bi@@ op@@ sy spec@@ im@@ ens in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproduc@@ tion toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequent@@ ly:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit out@@ weigh@@ s the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lact@@ ating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
program@@ me, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hyperten@@ sive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur.
At@@ tention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
General
Non-@@ specific skin rash@@ es have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu@@ -like@@ " symptoms such as headach@@ es, joint pain@@ s, feelings of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thromb@@ oc@@ yto@@ sis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thromboti@@ c/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemi@@ a, myocardial infarc@@ tion, cerebrovascular acc@@ id@@ ents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarc@@ tion), transient ischaemic attack@@ s, deep vein thrombosis, arter@@ ial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli@@ , aneurysms, re@@ tinal thrombosis, and clo@@ tting of an ar@@ tif@@ ic@@ ial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythro@@ blastopen@@ ia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed (see sections 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasi@@ a)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressu@@ re: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e. g. headaches and conf@@ used st@@ ate) and gener@@ alised ton@@ oc@@ lon@@ al seizu@@ res, requiring the im@@ mediate attention of a physician and inten@@ sive medical ca@@ re.
Parti@@ cular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migra@@ ine@@ - like headaches as a possible warning signal.
Sh@@ unt thrombo@@ ses may occur, especially in patients who have a ten@@ den@@ cy to hypotension or whose arter@@ io@@ venous fistul@@ ae ex@@ hibit complications (e. g. sten@@ oses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early sh@@ unt revision and thrombosis prophylax@@ is by administration of ac@@ etylsalic@@ ylic acid, for ex@@ amp@@ le, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hyperten@@ sion may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequent@@ ly, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
53 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General@@ ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
Sur@@ ger@@ y patients in autologous predonation program@@ mes
In@@ dependent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotom@@ y.
Therefore, routine volume replace@@ ment should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVT@@ s), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group@@ , although the clinical experience is limit@@ ed.
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic mar@@ gin of epoetin alfa is very wide@@ .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are exten@@ sions of the pharmacological effects of the hormon@@ e.
Phlebotom@@ y may be performed if exces@@ sively high haemoglobin levels occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: anti@@ anaemi@@ c, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glyco@@ protein that stimul@@ ates, as a mito@@ sis-stimulating factor and differenti@@ ating hormon@@ e, the formation of erythrocy@@ tes from pre@@ cur@@ sor@@ s of the stem cell compar@@ tment.
The apparent molec@@ ular weight of erythropoietin is 32,@@ 000 to 40,000 dal@@ ton.
The protein fra@@ ction of the molec@@ ule con@@ tribu@@ tes about 58% and consis@@ ts of 165 amino acid@@ s.
The four carbohydrate chains are attach@@ ed via three N-@@ glycosidic bon@@ ds and one O-@@ glycosidic bond to the protein@@ .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is iden@@ tical in its amino acid and carbohydrate com@@ position to endogen@@ ous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed has the highest possible pur@@ ity according to the pres@@ ent state of the ar@@ t.
In particul@@ ar, no resi@@ du@@ es of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, poly@@ cy@@ th@@ aemi@@ c mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocy@@ tes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59@@ Fe-@@ incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-@@ thy@@ mid@@ ine incorporation in the erythro@@ id nucle@@ ated spleen cells has been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell cultu@@ re) after inc@@ ubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultu@@ res of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leu@@ co@@ po@@ ie@@ sis.
Cyto@@ toxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detec@@ ted.
5@@ 4 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-@@ Hodgkin@@ 's lymphom@@ a, and 24 other haematological malignancie@@ s) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 pro@@ state, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour typ@@ es).
In two lar@@ ge, open-label studies, 26@@ 97 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were include@@ d, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour typ@@ es) and 802 with haematological malignancie@@ s.
In a pro@@ spec@@ tiv@@ e, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-@@ myelo@@ id malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemi@@ a-related sequelae (e. g. fatigu@@ e, decreased energy, and activity reduc@@ tion), as measured by the following instrum@@ ents and scal@@ es:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therap@@ y- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other sm@@ all@@ er, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in qual@@ ity of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLA@@ S, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examin@@ ed in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blin@@ d placebo-controlled studies and one was an open@@ - label study.
The studies either rec@@ ru@@ it@@ ed patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studi@@ es) or used patient popul@@ ations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indic@@ ate@@ d: anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radio@@ therapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl@@ ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratio@@ s for overall survival range@@ d between 1.@@ 25 and 2.@@ 47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown an consis@@ tent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common canc@@ ers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Over@@ all survival out@@ come in the trials could not be stati@@ sfac@@ tor@@ ily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A system@@ atic revie@@ w has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials.
Met@@ a-@@ analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point esti@@ mate of 1.@@ 08 in favour of control@@ s (95% CI:
0.@@ 99@@ , 1,18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.@@ 67@@ , 95% CI:
1.@@ 35@@ , 2.@@ 06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin@@ .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcom@@ es might app@@ ly to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is uncle@@ ar because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data revie@@ we@@ d.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Intravenous route
Me@@ asure@@ ment of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volun@@ te@@ ers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
55 18 hours post@@ dose.
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20@@ th of the valu@@ e).
There is no accumul@@ ation: the levels remain the sa@@ me, whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection.
The half-life is diff@@ ic@@ ult to evalu@@ ate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some pre@@ clinical toxic@@ ological studies in do@@ gs and rats, but not in monke@@ ys, epoetin alfa therapy was associated with sub@@ clinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyper@@ parathy@@ ro@@ idis@@ m or unknown fac@@ tors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a mat@@ ched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa@@ .).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.
These changes are inter@@ pre@@ ted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacter@@ ial and ma@@ mm@@ al@@ ian cell cul@@ ture mutagenicity te@@ sts and an in vivo micronucleus test in mic@@ e.
Lon@@ g-term carcin@@ ogenicity studies have not been carried ou@@ t.
There are conf@@ lic@@ ting reports in the lit@@ erature reg@@ ar@@ ding whether erythropoietins may pla@@ y a major role as tumour prolifer@@ ator@@ s.
These reports are based on in vitro find@@ ings from human tumour samp@@ les, but are of unc@@ ertain significance in the clinical situ@@ ation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (C@@ RF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal orig@@ in accomp@@ anied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion require@@ ments in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphom@@ a or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-@@ existing anaemia at the start of chemotherap@@ y).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme@@ .
Its use in this indication must be bal@@ anced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb@@ ) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.@@ 1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency@@ ), if blood sa@@ ving procedu@@ res are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for fe@@ males or 5 or more units for mal@@ es).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to al@@ lo@@ gen@@ ei@@ c blood transfusions in adult non-@@ iron def@@ icient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perc@@ ei@@ ved risk for transfusion complications.
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initi@@ ated under the supervision of physici@@ ans experienced in the management of patients with the above indic@@ ations.
5@@ 8 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration ai@@ med for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provi@@ ded.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose manage@@ ment, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25@@ %.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level@@ .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other causes of anaemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be exclu@@ ded before insti@@ tut@@ ing therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cau@@ ses: iron, fol@@ ate, or vitamin B12 deficiency@@ ; aluminium intoxic@@ ation@@ ; inter@@ current infec@@ tion@@ s; inflamm@@ atory or tra@@ um@@ atic episode@@ s; oc@@ cul@@ t blood loss@@ ; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any orig@@ in.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of at least four weeks.
At each step@@ , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.@@ 75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
59 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achie@@ ved.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
General@@ ly, children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adul@@ ts.
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment:
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usu@@ al maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equ@@ al injection@@ s.
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialy@@ sis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous rou@@ te, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg inc@@ rements (3 times per week@@ ) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four week@@ s).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemi@@ a:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
60 avoide@@ d; gu@@ id@@ ance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values excee@@ ding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following dia@@ gram@@ :
61 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
Tar@@ get Hb (appro@@ x.
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dis@@ continue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl@@ :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50@@ %.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme@@ :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of don@@ ating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedu@@ re.
Mil@@ dly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 - 39@@ %) requiring prede@@ posi@@ t of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.
200 mg oral ele@@ mental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous prede@@ posit@@ , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surger@@ y:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
62 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three weeks (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In cases where there is a medical need to shor@@ ten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 con@@ sec@@ utive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.
When performing haemat@@ olog@@ ic assess@@ ments during the pre@@ operative period, if the haemoglobin level rea@@ ches 15 g/ dl, or high@@ er, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the out@@ set of the treatment patients are not iron def@@ icient.
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron sto@@ res.
Method of administration
Adminis@@ ter the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depen@@ ding on the total dose.
In haemo@@ dialy@@ sed patients, a bol@@ us injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous por@@ t in the dialysis lin@@ e.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistul@@ a needle tub@@ ing, followed by 10 ml of isoton@@ ic sal@@ ine to rin@@ se the tu@@ bing and ensure sati@@ sfac@@ tory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is prefer@@ able in patients who reac@@ t to the treatment with “ flu@@ -like@@ ” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be excee@@ ded.
In case of larger volume@@ s, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injections are given in the th@@ igh@@ s or the anter@@ ior abdominal wall@@ .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutane@@ ous@@ ly@@ !
The intravenous route has to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develo@@ p Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasi@@ a).
Un@@ controlled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous bloo@@ d”@@ : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month pre@@ ce@@ ding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reas@@ on cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylax@@ is.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe cor@@ onar@@ y, peripheral arter@@ ial, car@@ oti@@ d or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident@@ .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inade@@ qu@@ ately treated
It may be necessary to ad@@ d or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This reg@@ resses during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficienc@@ ie@@ s) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optim@@ um response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron stores should be as@@ sure@@ d:
200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally (100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transfer@@ rin sat@@ ur@@ ation is below 20%.
All of these addi@@ tive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when dec@@ iding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practic@@ es should always be used in the per@@ is@@ urg@@ ical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patients develop@@ ing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month@@ ) with increased need for transfusion@@ s, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typ@@ ical causes of non-@@ response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxic@@ ation, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemoly@@ sis@@ ) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ inde@@ x”@@ ) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ mic@@ rolit@@ re or < 0.@@ 5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal@@ , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been fo@@ und, anti-@@ erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examin@@ ation should be considered for dia@@ gno@@ sis of PRC@@ A.
If anti-@@ erythropoietin, anti@@ body-mediated PRCA is suspec@@ ted, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be com@@ men@@ ced because of the risk of cro@@ ss@@ -reaction.
Appro@@ priate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patients
Immun@@ ogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for anti@@ body-@@ induced PRC@@ A, i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not suff@@ icient.
Therefore, in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intraven@@ ously.
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Con@@ trol@@ led clinical trials have not shown significant benefits at@@ trib@@ ut@@ able to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avo@@ id blood transfusion@@ .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
64 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension.
Hyper@@ kalaemia has been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intak@@ e.
Dialy@@ sis prescrip@@ tions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea@@ , creatin@@ ine and potassium in the desired range@@ .
Ser@@ um electroly@@ tes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or ris@@ ing) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ce@@ as@@ ing epoetin alfa administration until hyper@@ kalaemia has been correc@@ ted.
An increase in hep@@ ar@@ in dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occ@@ lu@@ sion of the dialysis system is possible if hep@@ arin@@ isation is not optim@@ um.
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically ev@@ id@@ ent ischaemic heart disease or con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to da@@ te, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accel@@ erate the rate of progression of renal insufficienc@@ y.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appe@@ arance of erythropoiet@@ in-@@ induced red cells should be taken into account when assess@@ ing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transf@@ use@@ d).
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)@@ m, the dose ad@@ ap@@ tation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (T@@ VE@@ s) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8@@ ), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa@@ ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embol@@ is@@ m).
An investig@@ ational study (BES@@ T study@@ ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was de@@ sign@@ ed to determin@@ e whether epoetin alfa treatment that exten@@ ded beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcom@@ es.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In vie@@ w of the abo@@ ve, in some clinical situ@@ ations blood transfusions should be the prefer@@ red treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.
The dec@@ is@@ ion to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benef@@ it@@ -risk assessment with the particip@@ ation of the individual patient@@ , which should also take into account the specific clinical con@@ tex@@ t.
Fac@@ tors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage@@ ; the de@@ gree of anaemi@@ a; life-@@ expec@@ tanc@@ y; the environ@@ ment in which the patient is being trea@@ te@@ d; and patient pre@@ feren@@ ce (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programme@@ s, especially routine volume replace@@ ment, should be respec@@ ted.
65 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thromboti@@ c events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylax@@ is, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special pre@@ caution should be taken in patients with pre@@ disposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT@@ s).
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tum@@ our growth potential
Erythropoietin@@ s are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth fac@@ tors, there is a conc@@ ern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tum@@ ours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have sho@@ wn@@ :
- decreased lo@@ co@@ region@@ al control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.@@ 7 mmol/ l),
- shor@@ ten@@ ed overall survival and increased deaths at@@ tribu@@ ted to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving nei@@ ther chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESA@@ s are not indicated for use in this patient popul@@ ation.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essen@@ tially “ sodi@@ um@@ - fre@@ e”@@ .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alter@@ s the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an inter@@ action.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclo@@ spor@@ in, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit ris@@ es.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differenti@@ ation or prolifer@@ ation of tumour bi@@ op@@ sy spec@@ im@@ ens in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproduc@@ tion toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequent@@ ly:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit out@@ weigh@@ s the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lact@@ ating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
program@@ me, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hyperten@@ sive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur.
At@@ tention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
General
Non-@@ specific skin rash@@ es have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu@@ -like@@ " symptoms such as headach@@ es, joint pain@@ s, feelings of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thromb@@ oc@@ yto@@ sis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thromboti@@ c/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemi@@ a, myocardial infarc@@ tion, cerebrovascular acc@@ id@@ ents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarc@@ tion), transient ischaemic attack@@ s, deep vein thrombosis, arter@@ ial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli@@ , aneurysms, re@@ tinal thrombosis, and clo@@ tting of an ar@@ tif@@ ic@@ ial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythro@@ blastopen@@ ia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed (see sections 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasi@@ a)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressu@@ re: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e. g. headaches and conf@@ used st@@ ate) and gener@@ alised ton@@ oc@@ lon@@ al seizu@@ res, requiring the im@@ mediate attention of a physician and inten@@ sive medical ca@@ re.
Parti@@ cular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migra@@ ine@@ - like headaches as a possible warning signal.
Sh@@ unt thrombo@@ ses may occur, especially in patients who have a ten@@ den@@ cy to hypotension or whose arter@@ io@@ venous fistul@@ ae ex@@ hibit complications (e. g. sten@@ oses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early sh@@ unt revision and thrombosis prophylax@@ is by administration of ac@@ etylsalic@@ ylic acid, for ex@@ amp@@ le, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hyperten@@ sion may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequent@@ ly, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
67 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General@@ ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
Sur@@ ger@@ y patients in autologous predonation program@@ mes
In@@ dependent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotom@@ y.
Therefore, routine volume replace@@ ment should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVT@@ s), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group@@ , although the clinical experience is limit@@ ed.
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic mar@@ gin of epoetin alfa is very wide@@ .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are exten@@ sions of the pharmacological effects of the hormon@@ e.
Phlebotom@@ y may be performed if exces@@ sively high haemoglobin levels occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: anti@@ anaemi@@ c, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glyco@@ protein that stimul@@ ates, as a mito@@ sis-stimulating factor and differenti@@ ating hormon@@ e, the formation of erythrocy@@ tes from pre@@ cur@@ sor@@ s of the stem cell compar@@ tment.
The apparent molec@@ ular weight of erythropoietin is 32,@@ 000 to 40,000 dal@@ ton.
The protein fra@@ ction of the molec@@ ule con@@ tribu@@ tes about 58% and consis@@ ts of 165 amino acid@@ s.
The four carbohydrate chains are attach@@ ed via three N-@@ glycosidic bon@@ ds and one O-@@ glycosidic bond to the protein@@ .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is iden@@ tical in its amino acid and carbohydrate com@@ position to endogen@@ ous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed has the highest possible pur@@ ity according to the pres@@ ent state of the ar@@ t.
In particul@@ ar, no resi@@ du@@ es of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, poly@@ cy@@ th@@ aemi@@ c mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocy@@ tes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59@@ Fe-@@ incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-@@ thy@@ mid@@ ine incorporation in the erythro@@ id nucle@@ ated spleen cells has been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell cultu@@ re) after inc@@ ubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultu@@ res of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leu@@ co@@ po@@ ie@@ sis.
Cyto@@ toxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detec@@ ted.
6@@ 8 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-@@ Hodgkin@@ 's lymphom@@ a, and 24 other haematological malignancie@@ s) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 pro@@ state, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour typ@@ es).
In two lar@@ ge, open-label studies, 26@@ 97 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were include@@ d, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour typ@@ es) and 802 with haematological malignancie@@ s.
In a pro@@ spec@@ tiv@@ e, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-@@ myelo@@ id malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemi@@ a-related sequelae (e. g. fatigu@@ e, decreased energy, and activity reduc@@ tion), as measured by the following instrum@@ ents and scal@@ es:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therap@@ y- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other sm@@ all@@ er, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in qual@@ ity of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLA@@ S, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examin@@ ed in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blin@@ d placebo-controlled studies and one was an open@@ - label study.
The studies either rec@@ ru@@ it@@ ed patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studi@@ es) or used patient popul@@ ations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indic@@ ate@@ d: anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radio@@ therapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl@@ ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratio@@ s for overall survival range@@ d between 1.@@ 25 and 2.@@ 47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown an consis@@ tent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common canc@@ ers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Over@@ all survival out@@ come in the trials could not be stati@@ sfac@@ tor@@ ily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A system@@ atic revie@@ w has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials.
Met@@ a-@@ analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point esti@@ mate of 1.@@ 08 in favour of control@@ s (95% CI:
0.@@ 99@@ , 1,18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.@@ 67@@ , 95% CI:
1.@@ 35@@ , 2.@@ 06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin@@ .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcom@@ es might app@@ ly to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is uncle@@ ar because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data revie@@ we@@ d.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Intravenous route
Me@@ asure@@ ment of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volun@@ te@@ ers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
69 18 hours post@@ dose.
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20@@ th of the valu@@ e).
There is no accumul@@ ation: the levels remain the sa@@ me, whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection.
The half-life is diff@@ ic@@ ult to evalu@@ ate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some pre@@ clinical toxic@@ ological studies in do@@ gs and rats, but not in monke@@ ys, epoetin alfa therapy was associated with sub@@ clinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyper@@ parathy@@ ro@@ idis@@ m or unknown fac@@ tors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a mat@@ ched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa@@ .).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.
These changes are inter@@ pre@@ ted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacter@@ ial and ma@@ mm@@ al@@ ian cell cul@@ ture mutagenicity te@@ sts and an in vivo micronucleus test in mic@@ e.
Lon@@ g-term carcin@@ ogenicity studies have not been carried ou@@ t.
There are conf@@ lic@@ ting reports in the lit@@ erature reg@@ ar@@ ding whether erythropoietins may pla@@ y a major role as tumour prolifer@@ ator@@ s.
These reports are based on in vitro find@@ ings from human tumour samp@@ les, but are of unc@@ ertain significance in the clinical situ@@ ation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (C@@ RF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal orig@@ in accomp@@ anied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion require@@ ments in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphom@@ a or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-@@ existing anaemia at the start of chemotherap@@ y).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme@@ .
Its use in this indication must be bal@@ anced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb@@ ) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.@@ 1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency@@ ), if blood sa@@ ving procedu@@ res are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for fe@@ males or 5 or more units for mal@@ es).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to al@@ lo@@ gen@@ ei@@ c blood transfusions in adult non-@@ iron def@@ icient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perc@@ ei@@ ved risk for transfusion complications.
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initi@@ ated under the supervision of physici@@ ans experienced in the management of patients with the above indic@@ ations.
72 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration ai@@ med for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provi@@ ded.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose manage@@ ment, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25@@ %.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level@@ .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other causes of anaemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be exclu@@ ded before insti@@ tut@@ ing therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cau@@ ses: iron, fol@@ ate, or vitamin B12 deficiency@@ ; aluminium intoxic@@ ation@@ ; inter@@ current infec@@ tion@@ s; inflamm@@ atory or tra@@ um@@ atic episode@@ s; oc@@ cul@@ t blood loss@@ ; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any orig@@ in.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of at least four weeks.
At each step@@ , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.@@ 75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
7@@ 3 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achie@@ ved.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
General@@ ly, children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adul@@ ts.
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment:
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usu@@ al maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equ@@ al injection@@ s.
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialy@@ sis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous rou@@ te, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg inc@@ rements (3 times per week@@ ) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four week@@ s).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemi@@ a:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
74 avoide@@ d; gu@@ id@@ ance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values excee@@ ding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following dia@@ gram@@ :
75 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
Tar@@ get Hb (appro@@ x.
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dis@@ continue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl@@ :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50@@ %.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme@@ :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of don@@ ating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedu@@ re.
Mil@@ dly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 - 39@@ %) requiring prede@@ posi@@ t of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.
200 mg oral ele@@ mental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous prede@@ posit@@ , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surger@@ y:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
7@@ 6 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three weeks (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In cases where there is a medical need to shor@@ ten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 con@@ sec@@ utive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.
When performing haemat@@ olog@@ ic assess@@ ments during the pre@@ operative period, if the haemoglobin level rea@@ ches 15 g/ dl, or high@@ er, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the out@@ set of the treatment patients are not iron def@@ icient.
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron sto@@ res.
Method of administration
Adminis@@ ter the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depen@@ ding on the total dose.
In haemo@@ dialy@@ sed patients, a bol@@ us injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous por@@ t in the dialysis lin@@ e.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistul@@ a needle tub@@ ing, followed by 10 ml of isoton@@ ic sal@@ ine to rin@@ se the tu@@ bing and ensure sati@@ sfac@@ tory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is prefer@@ able in patients who reac@@ t to the treatment with “ flu@@ -like@@ ” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be excee@@ ded.
In case of larger volume@@ s, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injections are given in the th@@ igh@@ s or the anter@@ ior abdominal wall@@ .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutane@@ ous@@ ly@@ !
The intravenous route has to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develo@@ p Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasi@@ a).
Un@@ controlled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous bloo@@ d”@@ : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month pre@@ ce@@ ding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reas@@ on cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylax@@ is.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe cor@@ onar@@ y, peripheral arter@@ ial, car@@ oti@@ d or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident@@ .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inade@@ qu@@ ately treated
It may be necessary to ad@@ d or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This reg@@ resses during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficienc@@ ie@@ s) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optim@@ um response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron stores should be as@@ sure@@ d:
200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally (100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transfer@@ rin sat@@ ur@@ ation is below 20%.
All of these addi@@ tive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when dec@@ iding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practic@@ es should always be used in the per@@ is@@ urg@@ ical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patients develop@@ ing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month@@ ) with increased need for transfusion@@ s, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typ@@ ical causes of non-@@ response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxic@@ ation, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemoly@@ sis@@ ) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ inde@@ x”@@ ) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ mic@@ rolit@@ re or < 0.@@ 5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal@@ , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been fo@@ und, anti-@@ erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examin@@ ation should be considered for dia@@ gno@@ sis of PRC@@ A.
If anti-@@ erythropoietin, anti@@ body-mediated PRCA is suspec@@ ted, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be com@@ men@@ ced because of the risk of cro@@ ss@@ -reaction.
Appro@@ priate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patients
Immun@@ ogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for anti@@ body-@@ induced PRC@@ A, i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not suff@@ icient.
Therefore, in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intraven@@ ously.
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Con@@ trol@@ led clinical trials have not shown significant benefits at@@ trib@@ ut@@ able to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avo@@ id blood transfusion@@ .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
78 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension.
Hyper@@ kalaemia has been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intak@@ e.
Dialy@@ sis prescrip@@ tions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea@@ , creatin@@ ine and potassium in the desired range@@ .
Ser@@ um electroly@@ tes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or ris@@ ing) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ce@@ as@@ ing epoetin alfa administration until hyper@@ kalaemia has been correc@@ ted.
An increase in hep@@ ar@@ in dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occ@@ lu@@ sion of the dialysis system is possible if hep@@ arin@@ isation is not optim@@ um.
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically ev@@ id@@ ent ischaemic heart disease or con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to da@@ te, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accel@@ erate the rate of progression of renal insufficienc@@ y.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appe@@ arance of erythropoiet@@ in-@@ induced red cells should be taken into account when assess@@ ing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transf@@ use@@ d).
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)@@ m, the dose ad@@ ap@@ tation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (T@@ VE@@ s) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8@@ ), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa@@ ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embol@@ is@@ m).
An investig@@ ational study (BES@@ T study@@ ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was de@@ sign@@ ed to determin@@ e whether epoetin alfa treatment that exten@@ ded beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcom@@ es.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In vie@@ w of the abo@@ ve, in some clinical situ@@ ations blood transfusions should be the prefer@@ red treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.
The dec@@ is@@ ion to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benef@@ it@@ -risk assessment with the particip@@ ation of the individual patient@@ , which should also take into account the specific clinical con@@ tex@@ t.
Fac@@ tors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage@@ ; the de@@ gree of anaemi@@ a; life-@@ expec@@ tanc@@ y; the environ@@ ment in which the patient is being trea@@ te@@ d; and patient pre@@ feren@@ ce (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programme@@ s, especially routine volume replace@@ ment, should be respec@@ ted.
7@@ 9 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thromboti@@ c events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylax@@ is, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special pre@@ caution should be taken in patients with pre@@ disposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT@@ s).
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tum@@ our growth potential
Erythropoietin@@ s are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth fac@@ tors, there is a conc@@ ern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tum@@ ours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have sho@@ wn@@ :
- decreased lo@@ co@@ region@@ al control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.@@ 7 mmol/ l),
- shor@@ ten@@ ed overall survival and increased deaths at@@ tribu@@ ted to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving nei@@ ther chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESA@@ s are not indicated for use in this patient popul@@ ation.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essen@@ tially “ sodi@@ um@@ - fre@@ e”@@ .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alter@@ s the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an inter@@ action.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclo@@ spor@@ in, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit ris@@ es.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differenti@@ ation or prolifer@@ ation of tumour bi@@ op@@ sy spec@@ im@@ ens in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproduc@@ tion toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequent@@ ly:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit out@@ weigh@@ s the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lact@@ ating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
program@@ me, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hyperten@@ sive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur.
At@@ tention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
General
Non-@@ specific skin rash@@ es have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu@@ -like@@ " symptoms such as headach@@ es, joint pain@@ s, feelings of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thromb@@ oc@@ yto@@ sis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thromboti@@ c/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemi@@ a, myocardial infarc@@ tion, cerebrovascular acc@@ id@@ ents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarc@@ tion), transient ischaemic attack@@ s, deep vein thrombosis, arter@@ ial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli@@ , aneurysms, re@@ tinal thrombosis, and clo@@ tting of an ar@@ tif@@ ic@@ ial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythro@@ blastopen@@ ia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed (see sections 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasi@@ a)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressu@@ re: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e. g. headaches and conf@@ used st@@ ate) and gener@@ alised ton@@ oc@@ lon@@ al seizu@@ res, requiring the im@@ mediate attention of a physician and inten@@ sive medical ca@@ re.
Parti@@ cular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migra@@ ine@@ - like headaches as a possible warning signal.
Sh@@ unt thrombo@@ ses may occur, especially in patients who have a ten@@ den@@ cy to hypotension or whose arter@@ io@@ venous fistul@@ ae ex@@ hibit complications (e. g. sten@@ oses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early sh@@ unt revision and thrombosis prophylax@@ is by administration of ac@@ etylsalic@@ ylic acid, for ex@@ amp@@ le, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hyperten@@ sion may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequent@@ ly, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
81 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General@@ ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
Sur@@ ger@@ y patients in autologous predonation program@@ mes
In@@ dependent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotom@@ y.
Therefore, routine volume replace@@ ment should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVT@@ s), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group@@ , although the clinical experience is limit@@ ed.
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic mar@@ gin of epoetin alfa is very wide@@ .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are exten@@ sions of the pharmacological effects of the hormon@@ e.
Phlebotom@@ y may be performed if exces@@ sively high haemoglobin levels occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: anti@@ anaemi@@ c, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glyco@@ protein that stimul@@ ates, as a mito@@ sis-stimulating factor and differenti@@ ating hormon@@ e, the formation of erythrocy@@ tes from pre@@ cur@@ sor@@ s of the stem cell compar@@ tment.
The apparent molec@@ ular weight of erythropoietin is 32,@@ 000 to 40,000 dal@@ ton.
The protein fra@@ ction of the molec@@ ule con@@ tribu@@ tes about 58% and consis@@ ts of 165 amino acid@@ s.
The four carbohydrate chains are attach@@ ed via three N-@@ glycosidic bon@@ ds and one O-@@ glycosidic bond to the protein@@ .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is iden@@ tical in its amino acid and carbohydrate com@@ position to endogen@@ ous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed has the highest possible pur@@ ity according to the pres@@ ent state of the ar@@ t.
In particul@@ ar, no resi@@ du@@ es of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, poly@@ cy@@ th@@ aemi@@ c mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocy@@ tes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59@@ Fe-@@ incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-@@ thy@@ mid@@ ine incorporation in the erythro@@ id nucle@@ ated spleen cells has been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell cultu@@ re) after inc@@ ubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultu@@ res of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leu@@ co@@ po@@ ie@@ sis.
Cyto@@ toxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detec@@ ted.
8@@ 2 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-@@ Hodgkin@@ 's lymphom@@ a, and 24 other haematological malignancie@@ s) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 pro@@ state, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour typ@@ es).
In two lar@@ ge, open-label studies, 26@@ 97 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were include@@ d, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour typ@@ es) and 802 with haematological malignancie@@ s.
In a pro@@ spec@@ tiv@@ e, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-@@ myelo@@ id malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemi@@ a-related sequelae (e. g. fatigu@@ e, decreased energy, and activity reduc@@ tion), as measured by the following instrum@@ ents and scal@@ es:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therap@@ y- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other sm@@ all@@ er, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in qual@@ ity of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLA@@ S, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examin@@ ed in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blin@@ d placebo-controlled studies and one was an open@@ - label study.
The studies either rec@@ ru@@ it@@ ed patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studi@@ es) or used patient popul@@ ations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indic@@ ate@@ d: anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radio@@ therapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl@@ ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratio@@ s for overall survival range@@ d between 1.@@ 25 and 2.@@ 47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown an consis@@ tent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common canc@@ ers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Over@@ all survival out@@ come in the trials could not be stati@@ sfac@@ tor@@ ily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A system@@ atic revie@@ w has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials.
Met@@ a-@@ analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point esti@@ mate of 1.@@ 08 in favour of control@@ s (95% CI:
0.@@ 99@@ , 1,18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.@@ 67@@ , 95% CI:
1.@@ 35@@ , 2.@@ 06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin@@ .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcom@@ es might app@@ ly to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is uncle@@ ar because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data revie@@ we@@ d.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Intravenous route
Me@@ asure@@ ment of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volun@@ te@@ ers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
83 18 hours post@@ dose.
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20@@ th of the valu@@ e).
There is no accumul@@ ation: the levels remain the sa@@ me, whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection.
The half-life is diff@@ ic@@ ult to evalu@@ ate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some pre@@ clinical toxic@@ ological studies in do@@ gs and rats, but not in monke@@ ys, epoetin alfa therapy was associated with sub@@ clinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyper@@ parathy@@ ro@@ idis@@ m or unknown fac@@ tors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a mat@@ ched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa@@ .).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.
These changes are inter@@ pre@@ ted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacter@@ ial and ma@@ mm@@ al@@ ian cell cul@@ ture mutagenicity te@@ sts and an in vivo micronucleus test in mic@@ e.
Lon@@ g-term carcin@@ ogenicity studies have not been carried ou@@ t.
There are conf@@ lic@@ ting reports in the lit@@ erature reg@@ ar@@ ding whether erythropoietins may pla@@ y a major role as tumour prolifer@@ ator@@ s.
These reports are based on in vitro find@@ ings from human tumour samp@@ les, but are of unc@@ ertain significance in the clinical situ@@ ation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (C@@ RF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal orig@@ in accomp@@ anied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion require@@ ments in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphom@@ a or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-@@ existing anaemia at the start of chemotherap@@ y).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme@@ .
Its use in this indication must be bal@@ anced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb@@ ) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.@@ 1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency@@ ), if blood sa@@ ving procedu@@ res are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for fe@@ males or 5 or more units for mal@@ es).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to al@@ lo@@ gen@@ ei@@ c blood transfusions in adult non-@@ iron def@@ icient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perc@@ ei@@ ved risk for transfusion complications.
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initi@@ ated under the supervision of physici@@ ans experienced in the management of patients with the above indic@@ ations.
8@@ 6 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration ai@@ med for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provi@@ ded.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose manage@@ ment, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25@@ %.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level@@ .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other causes of anaemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be exclu@@ ded before insti@@ tut@@ ing therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cau@@ ses: iron, fol@@ ate, or vitamin B12 deficiency@@ ; aluminium intoxic@@ ation@@ ; inter@@ current infec@@ tion@@ s; inflamm@@ atory or tra@@ um@@ atic episode@@ s; oc@@ cul@@ t blood loss@@ ; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any orig@@ in.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of at least four weeks.
At each step@@ , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.@@ 75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
8@@ 7 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achie@@ ved.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
General@@ ly, children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adul@@ ts.
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment:
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usu@@ al maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equ@@ al injection@@ s.
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialy@@ sis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous rou@@ te, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg inc@@ rements (3 times per week@@ ) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four week@@ s).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemi@@ a:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
88 avoide@@ d; gu@@ id@@ ance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values excee@@ ding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following dia@@ gram@@ :
89 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
Tar@@ get Hb (appro@@ x.
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dis@@ continue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl@@ :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50@@ %.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme@@ :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of don@@ ating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedu@@ re.
Mil@@ dly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 - 39@@ %) requiring prede@@ posi@@ t of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.
200 mg oral ele@@ mental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous prede@@ posit@@ , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surger@@ y:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
90 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three weeks (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In cases where there is a medical need to shor@@ ten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 con@@ sec@@ utive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.
When performing haemat@@ olog@@ ic assess@@ ments during the pre@@ operative period, if the haemoglobin level rea@@ ches 15 g/ dl, or high@@ er, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the out@@ set of the treatment patients are not iron def@@ icient.
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron sto@@ res.
Method of administration
Adminis@@ ter the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depen@@ ding on the total dose.
In haemo@@ dialy@@ sed patients, a bol@@ us injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous por@@ t in the dialysis lin@@ e.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistul@@ a needle tub@@ ing, followed by 10 ml of isoton@@ ic sal@@ ine to rin@@ se the tu@@ bing and ensure sati@@ sfac@@ tory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is prefer@@ able in patients who reac@@ t to the treatment with “ flu@@ -like@@ ” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be excee@@ ded.
In case of larger volume@@ s, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injections are given in the th@@ igh@@ s or the anter@@ ior abdominal wall@@ .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutane@@ ous@@ ly@@ !
The intravenous route has to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develo@@ p Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasi@@ a).
Un@@ controlled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous bloo@@ d”@@ : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month pre@@ ce@@ ding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reas@@ on cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylax@@ is.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe cor@@ onar@@ y, peripheral arter@@ ial, car@@ oti@@ d or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident@@ .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inade@@ qu@@ ately treated
It may be necessary to ad@@ d or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This reg@@ resses during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficienc@@ ie@@ s) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optim@@ um response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron stores should be as@@ sure@@ d:
200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally (100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transfer@@ rin sat@@ ur@@ ation is below 20%.
All of these addi@@ tive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when dec@@ iding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practic@@ es should always be used in the per@@ is@@ urg@@ ical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patients develop@@ ing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month@@ ) with increased need for transfusion@@ s, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typ@@ ical causes of non-@@ response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxic@@ ation, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemoly@@ sis@@ ) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ inde@@ x”@@ ) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ mic@@ rolit@@ re or < 0.@@ 5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal@@ , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been fo@@ und, anti-@@ erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examin@@ ation should be considered for dia@@ gno@@ sis of PRC@@ A.
If anti-@@ erythropoietin, anti@@ body-mediated PRCA is suspec@@ ted, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be com@@ men@@ ced because of the risk of cro@@ ss@@ -reaction.
Appro@@ priate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patients
Immun@@ ogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for anti@@ body-@@ induced PRC@@ A, i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not suff@@ icient.
Therefore, in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intraven@@ ously.
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Con@@ trol@@ led clinical trials have not shown significant benefits at@@ trib@@ ut@@ able to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avo@@ id blood transfusion@@ .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
9@@ 2 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension.
Hyper@@ kalaemia has been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intak@@ e.
Dialy@@ sis prescrip@@ tions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea@@ , creatin@@ ine and potassium in the desired range@@ .
Ser@@ um electroly@@ tes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or ris@@ ing) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ce@@ as@@ ing epoetin alfa administration until hyper@@ kalaemia has been correc@@ ted.
An increase in hep@@ ar@@ in dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occ@@ lu@@ sion of the dialysis system is possible if hep@@ arin@@ isation is not optim@@ um.
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically ev@@ id@@ ent ischaemic heart disease or con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to da@@ te, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accel@@ erate the rate of progression of renal insufficienc@@ y.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appe@@ arance of erythropoiet@@ in-@@ induced red cells should be taken into account when assess@@ ing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transf@@ use@@ d).
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)@@ m, the dose ad@@ ap@@ tation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (T@@ VE@@ s) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8@@ ), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa@@ ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embol@@ is@@ m).
An investig@@ ational study (BES@@ T study@@ ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was de@@ sign@@ ed to determin@@ e whether epoetin alfa treatment that exten@@ ded beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcom@@ es.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In vie@@ w of the abo@@ ve, in some clinical situ@@ ations blood transfusions should be the prefer@@ red treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.
The dec@@ is@@ ion to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benef@@ it@@ -risk assessment with the particip@@ ation of the individual patient@@ , which should also take into account the specific clinical con@@ tex@@ t.
Fac@@ tors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage@@ ; the de@@ gree of anaemi@@ a; life-@@ expec@@ tanc@@ y; the environ@@ ment in which the patient is being trea@@ te@@ d; and patient pre@@ feren@@ ce (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programme@@ s, especially routine volume replace@@ ment, should be respec@@ ted.
93 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thromboti@@ c events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylax@@ is, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special pre@@ caution should be taken in patients with pre@@ disposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT@@ s).
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tum@@ our growth potential
Erythropoietin@@ s are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth fac@@ tors, there is a conc@@ ern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tum@@ ours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have sho@@ wn@@ :
- decreased lo@@ co@@ region@@ al control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.@@ 7 mmol/ l),
- shor@@ ten@@ ed overall survival and increased deaths at@@ tribu@@ ted to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving nei@@ ther chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESA@@ s are not indicated for use in this patient popul@@ ation.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essen@@ tially “ sodi@@ um@@ - fre@@ e”@@ .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alter@@ s the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an inter@@ action.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclo@@ spor@@ in, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit ris@@ es.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differenti@@ ation or prolifer@@ ation of tumour bi@@ op@@ sy spec@@ im@@ ens in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproduc@@ tion toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequent@@ ly:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit out@@ weigh@@ s the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lact@@ ating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
program@@ me, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hyperten@@ sive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur.
At@@ tention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
General
Non-@@ specific skin rash@@ es have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu@@ -like@@ " symptoms such as headach@@ es, joint pain@@ s, feelings of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thromb@@ oc@@ yto@@ sis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thromboti@@ c/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemi@@ a, myocardial infarc@@ tion, cerebrovascular acc@@ id@@ ents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarc@@ tion), transient ischaemic attack@@ s, deep vein thrombosis, arter@@ ial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli@@ , aneurysms, re@@ tinal thrombosis, and clo@@ tting of an ar@@ tif@@ ic@@ ial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythro@@ blastopen@@ ia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed (see sections 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasi@@ a)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressu@@ re: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e. g. headaches and conf@@ used st@@ ate) and gener@@ alised ton@@ oc@@ lon@@ al seizu@@ res, requiring the im@@ mediate attention of a physician and inten@@ sive medical ca@@ re.
Parti@@ cular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migra@@ ine@@ - like headaches as a possible warning signal.
Sh@@ unt thrombo@@ ses may occur, especially in patients who have a ten@@ den@@ cy to hypotension or whose arter@@ io@@ venous fistul@@ ae ex@@ hibit complications (e. g. sten@@ oses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early sh@@ unt revision and thrombosis prophylax@@ is by administration of ac@@ etylsalic@@ ylic acid, for ex@@ amp@@ le, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hyperten@@ sion may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequent@@ ly, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
95 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General@@ ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
Sur@@ ger@@ y patients in autologous predonation program@@ mes
In@@ dependent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotom@@ y.
Therefore, routine volume replace@@ ment should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVT@@ s), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group@@ , although the clinical experience is limit@@ ed.
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic mar@@ gin of epoetin alfa is very wide@@ .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are exten@@ sions of the pharmacological effects of the hormon@@ e.
Phlebotom@@ y may be performed if exces@@ sively high haemoglobin levels occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: anti@@ anaemi@@ c, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glyco@@ protein that stimul@@ ates, as a mito@@ sis-stimulating factor and differenti@@ ating hormon@@ e, the formation of erythrocy@@ tes from pre@@ cur@@ sor@@ s of the stem cell compar@@ tment.
The apparent molec@@ ular weight of erythropoietin is 32,@@ 000 to 40,000 dal@@ ton.
The protein fra@@ ction of the molec@@ ule con@@ tribu@@ tes about 58% and consis@@ ts of 165 amino acid@@ s.
The four carbohydrate chains are attach@@ ed via three N-@@ glycosidic bon@@ ds and one O-@@ glycosidic bond to the protein@@ .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is iden@@ tical in its amino acid and carbohydrate com@@ position to endogen@@ ous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed has the highest possible pur@@ ity according to the pres@@ ent state of the ar@@ t.
In particul@@ ar, no resi@@ du@@ es of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, poly@@ cy@@ th@@ aemi@@ c mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocy@@ tes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59@@ Fe-@@ incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-@@ thy@@ mid@@ ine incorporation in the erythro@@ id nucle@@ ated spleen cells has been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell cultu@@ re) after inc@@ ubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultu@@ res of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leu@@ co@@ po@@ ie@@ sis.
Cyto@@ toxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detec@@ ted.
9@@ 6 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-@@ Hodgkin@@ 's lymphom@@ a, and 24 other haematological malignancie@@ s) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 pro@@ state, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour typ@@ es).
In two lar@@ ge, open-label studies, 26@@ 97 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were include@@ d, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour typ@@ es) and 802 with haematological malignancie@@ s.
In a pro@@ spec@@ tiv@@ e, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-@@ myelo@@ id malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemi@@ a-related sequelae (e. g. fatigu@@ e, decreased energy, and activity reduc@@ tion), as measured by the following instrum@@ ents and scal@@ es:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therap@@ y- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other sm@@ all@@ er, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in qual@@ ity of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLA@@ S, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examin@@ ed in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blin@@ d placebo-controlled studies and one was an open@@ - label study.
The studies either rec@@ ru@@ it@@ ed patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studi@@ es) or used patient popul@@ ations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indic@@ ate@@ d: anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radio@@ therapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl@@ ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratio@@ s for overall survival range@@ d between 1.@@ 25 and 2.@@ 47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown an consis@@ tent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common canc@@ ers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Over@@ all survival out@@ come in the trials could not be stati@@ sfac@@ tor@@ ily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A system@@ atic revie@@ w has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials.
Met@@ a-@@ analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point esti@@ mate of 1.@@ 08 in favour of control@@ s (95% CI:
0.@@ 99@@ , 1,18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.@@ 67@@ , 95% CI:
1.@@ 35@@ , 2.@@ 06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin@@ .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcom@@ es might app@@ ly to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is uncle@@ ar because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data revie@@ we@@ d.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Intravenous route
Me@@ asure@@ ment of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volun@@ te@@ ers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
97 18 hours post@@ dose.
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20@@ th of the valu@@ e).
There is no accumul@@ ation: the levels remain the sa@@ me, whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection.
The half-life is diff@@ ic@@ ult to evalu@@ ate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some pre@@ clinical toxic@@ ological studies in do@@ gs and rats, but not in monke@@ ys, epoetin alfa therapy was associated with sub@@ clinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyper@@ parathy@@ ro@@ idis@@ m or unknown fac@@ tors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a mat@@ ched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa@@ .).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.
These changes are inter@@ pre@@ ted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacter@@ ial and ma@@ mm@@ al@@ ian cell cul@@ ture mutagenicity te@@ sts and an in vivo micronucleus test in mic@@ e.
Lon@@ g-term carcin@@ ogenicity studies have not been carried ou@@ t.
There are conf@@ lic@@ ting reports in the lit@@ erature reg@@ ar@@ ding whether erythropoietins may pla@@ y a major role as tumour prolifer@@ ator@@ s.
These reports are based on in vitro find@@ ings from human tumour samp@@ les, but are of unc@@ ertain significance in the clinical situ@@ ation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (C@@ RF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal orig@@ in accomp@@ anied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion require@@ ments in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphom@@ a or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-@@ existing anaemia at the start of chemotherap@@ y).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme@@ .
Its use in this indication must be bal@@ anced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb@@ ) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.@@ 1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency@@ ), if blood sa@@ ving procedu@@ res are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for fe@@ males or 5 or more units for mal@@ es).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to al@@ lo@@ gen@@ ei@@ c blood transfusions in adult non-@@ iron def@@ icient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perc@@ ei@@ ved risk for transfusion complications.
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initi@@ ated under the supervision of physici@@ ans experienced in the management of patients with the above indic@@ ations.
100 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration ai@@ med for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provi@@ ded.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose manage@@ ment, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25@@ %.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level@@ .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other causes of anaemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be exclu@@ ded before insti@@ tut@@ ing therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cau@@ ses: iron, fol@@ ate, or vitamin B12 deficiency@@ ; aluminium intoxic@@ ation@@ ; inter@@ current infec@@ tion@@ s; inflamm@@ atory or tra@@ um@@ atic episode@@ s; oc@@ cul@@ t blood loss@@ ; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any orig@@ in.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of at least four weeks.
At each step@@ , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.@@ 75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
10@@ 1 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achie@@ ved.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
General@@ ly, children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adul@@ ts.
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment:
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usu@@ al maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equ@@ al injection@@ s.
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialy@@ sis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous rou@@ te, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg inc@@ rements (3 times per week@@ ) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four week@@ s).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemi@@ a:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
10@@ 2 avoide@@ d; gu@@ id@@ ance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values excee@@ ding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following dia@@ gram@@ :
10@@ 3 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
Tar@@ get Hb (appro@@ x.
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dis@@ continue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl@@ :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50@@ %.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme@@ :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of don@@ ating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedu@@ re.
Mil@@ dly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 - 39@@ %) requiring prede@@ posi@@ t of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.
200 mg oral ele@@ mental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous prede@@ posit@@ , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surger@@ y:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
104 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three weeks (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In cases where there is a medical need to shor@@ ten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 con@@ sec@@ utive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.
When performing haemat@@ olog@@ ic assess@@ ments during the pre@@ operative period, if the haemoglobin level rea@@ ches 15 g/ dl, or high@@ er, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the out@@ set of the treatment patients are not iron def@@ icient.
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron sto@@ res.
Method of administration
Adminis@@ ter the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depen@@ ding on the total dose.
In haemo@@ dialy@@ sed patients, a bol@@ us injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous por@@ t in the dialysis lin@@ e.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistul@@ a needle tub@@ ing, followed by 10 ml of isoton@@ ic sal@@ ine to rin@@ se the tu@@ bing and ensure sati@@ sfac@@ tory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is prefer@@ able in patients who reac@@ t to the treatment with “ flu@@ -like@@ ” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be excee@@ ded.
In case of larger volume@@ s, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injections are given in the th@@ igh@@ s or the anter@@ ior abdominal wall@@ .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutane@@ ous@@ ly@@ !
The intravenous route has to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develo@@ p Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasi@@ a).
Un@@ controlled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous bloo@@ d”@@ : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month pre@@ ce@@ ding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reas@@ on cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylax@@ is.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe cor@@ onar@@ y, peripheral arter@@ ial, car@@ oti@@ d or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident@@ .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inade@@ qu@@ ately treated
It may be necessary to ad@@ d or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This reg@@ resses during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficienc@@ ie@@ s) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optim@@ um response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron stores should be as@@ sure@@ d:
200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally (100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transfer@@ rin sat@@ ur@@ ation is below 20%.
All of these addi@@ tive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when dec@@ iding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practic@@ es should always be used in the per@@ is@@ urg@@ ical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patients develop@@ ing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month@@ ) with increased need for transfusion@@ s, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typ@@ ical causes of non-@@ response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxic@@ ation, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemoly@@ sis@@ ) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ inde@@ x”@@ ) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ mic@@ rolit@@ re or < 0.@@ 5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal@@ , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been fo@@ und, anti-@@ erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examin@@ ation should be considered for dia@@ gno@@ sis of PRC@@ A.
If anti-@@ erythropoietin, anti@@ body-mediated PRCA is suspec@@ ted, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be com@@ men@@ ced because of the risk of cro@@ ss@@ -reaction.
Appro@@ priate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patients
Immun@@ ogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for anti@@ body-@@ induced PRC@@ A, i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not suff@@ icient.
Therefore, in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intraven@@ ously.
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Con@@ trol@@ led clinical trials have not shown significant benefits at@@ trib@@ ut@@ able to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avo@@ id blood transfusion@@ .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
10@@ 6 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension.
Hyper@@ kalaemia has been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intak@@ e.
Dialy@@ sis prescrip@@ tions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea@@ , creatin@@ ine and potassium in the desired range@@ .
Ser@@ um electroly@@ tes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or ris@@ ing) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ce@@ as@@ ing epoetin alfa administration until hyper@@ kalaemia has been correc@@ ted.
An increase in hep@@ ar@@ in dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occ@@ lu@@ sion of the dialysis system is possible if hep@@ arin@@ isation is not optim@@ um.
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically ev@@ id@@ ent ischaemic heart disease or con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to da@@ te, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accel@@ erate the rate of progression of renal insufficienc@@ y.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appe@@ arance of erythropoiet@@ in-@@ induced red cells should be taken into account when assess@@ ing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transf@@ use@@ d).
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)@@ m, the dose ad@@ ap@@ tation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (T@@ VE@@ s) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8@@ ), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa@@ ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embol@@ is@@ m).
An investig@@ ational study (BES@@ T study@@ ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was de@@ sign@@ ed to determin@@ e whether epoetin alfa treatment that exten@@ ded beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcom@@ es.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In vie@@ w of the abo@@ ve, in some clinical situ@@ ations blood transfusions should be the prefer@@ red treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.
The dec@@ is@@ ion to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benef@@ it@@ -risk assessment with the particip@@ ation of the individual patient@@ , which should also take into account the specific clinical con@@ tex@@ t.
Fac@@ tors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage@@ ; the de@@ gree of anaemi@@ a; life-@@ expec@@ tanc@@ y; the environ@@ ment in which the patient is being trea@@ te@@ d; and patient pre@@ feren@@ ce (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programme@@ s, especially routine volume replace@@ ment, should be respec@@ ted.
10@@ 7 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thromboti@@ c events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylax@@ is, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special pre@@ caution should be taken in patients with pre@@ disposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT@@ s).
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tum@@ our growth potential
Erythropoietin@@ s are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth fac@@ tors, there is a conc@@ ern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tum@@ ours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have sho@@ wn@@ :
- decreased lo@@ co@@ region@@ al control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.@@ 7 mmol/ l),
- shor@@ ten@@ ed overall survival and increased deaths at@@ tribu@@ ted to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving nei@@ ther chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESA@@ s are not indicated for use in this patient popul@@ ation.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essen@@ tially “ sodi@@ um@@ - fre@@ e”@@ .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alter@@ s the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an inter@@ action.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclo@@ spor@@ in, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit ris@@ es.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differenti@@ ation or prolifer@@ ation of tumour bi@@ op@@ sy spec@@ im@@ ens in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproduc@@ tion toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequent@@ ly:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit out@@ weigh@@ s the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lact@@ ating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
program@@ me, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hyperten@@ sive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur.
At@@ tention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
General
Non-@@ specific skin rash@@ es have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu@@ -like@@ " symptoms such as headach@@ es, joint pain@@ s, feelings of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thromb@@ oc@@ yto@@ sis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thromboti@@ c/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemi@@ a, myocardial infarc@@ tion, cerebrovascular acc@@ id@@ ents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarc@@ tion), transient ischaemic attack@@ s, deep vein thrombosis, arter@@ ial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli@@ , aneurysms, re@@ tinal thrombosis, and clo@@ tting of an ar@@ tif@@ ic@@ ial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythro@@ blastopen@@ ia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed (see sections 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasi@@ a)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressu@@ re: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e. g. headaches and conf@@ used st@@ ate) and gener@@ alised ton@@ oc@@ lon@@ al seizu@@ res, requiring the im@@ mediate attention of a physician and inten@@ sive medical ca@@ re.
Parti@@ cular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migra@@ ine@@ - like headaches as a possible warning signal.
Sh@@ unt thrombo@@ ses may occur, especially in patients who have a ten@@ den@@ cy to hypotension or whose arter@@ io@@ venous fistul@@ ae ex@@ hibit complications (e. g. sten@@ oses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early sh@@ unt revision and thrombosis prophylax@@ is by administration of ac@@ etylsalic@@ ylic acid, for ex@@ amp@@ le, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hyperten@@ sion may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequent@@ ly, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
10@@ 9 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General@@ ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
Sur@@ ger@@ y patients in autologous predonation program@@ mes
In@@ dependent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotom@@ y.
Therefore, routine volume replace@@ ment should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVT@@ s), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group@@ , although the clinical experience is limit@@ ed.
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic mar@@ gin of epoetin alfa is very wide@@ .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are exten@@ sions of the pharmacological effects of the hormon@@ e.
Phlebotom@@ y may be performed if exces@@ sively high haemoglobin levels occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: anti@@ anaemi@@ c, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glyco@@ protein that stimul@@ ates, as a mito@@ sis-stimulating factor and differenti@@ ating hormon@@ e, the formation of erythrocy@@ tes from pre@@ cur@@ sor@@ s of the stem cell compar@@ tment.
The apparent molec@@ ular weight of erythropoietin is 32,@@ 000 to 40,000 dal@@ ton.
The protein fra@@ ction of the molec@@ ule con@@ tribu@@ tes about 58% and consis@@ ts of 165 amino acid@@ s.
The four carbohydrate chains are attach@@ ed via three N-@@ glycosidic bon@@ ds and one O-@@ glycosidic bond to the protein@@ .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is iden@@ tical in its amino acid and carbohydrate com@@ position to endogen@@ ous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed has the highest possible pur@@ ity according to the pres@@ ent state of the ar@@ t.
In particul@@ ar, no resi@@ du@@ es of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, poly@@ cy@@ th@@ aemi@@ c mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocy@@ tes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59@@ Fe-@@ incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-@@ thy@@ mid@@ ine incorporation in the erythro@@ id nucle@@ ated spleen cells has been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell cultu@@ re) after inc@@ ubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultu@@ res of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leu@@ co@@ po@@ ie@@ sis.
Cyto@@ toxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detec@@ ted.
1@@ 10 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-@@ Hodgkin@@ 's lymphom@@ a, and 24 other haematological malignancie@@ s) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 pro@@ state, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour typ@@ es).
In two lar@@ ge, open-label studies, 26@@ 97 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were include@@ d, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour typ@@ es) and 802 with haematological malignancie@@ s.
In a pro@@ spec@@ tiv@@ e, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-@@ myelo@@ id malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemi@@ a-related sequelae (e. g. fatigu@@ e, decreased energy, and activity reduc@@ tion), as measured by the following instrum@@ ents and scal@@ es:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therap@@ y- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other sm@@ all@@ er, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in qual@@ ity of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLA@@ S, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examin@@ ed in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blin@@ d placebo-controlled studies and one was an open@@ - label study.
The studies either rec@@ ru@@ it@@ ed patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studi@@ es) or used patient popul@@ ations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indic@@ ate@@ d: anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radio@@ therapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl@@ ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratio@@ s for overall survival range@@ d between 1.@@ 25 and 2.@@ 47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown an consis@@ tent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common canc@@ ers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Over@@ all survival out@@ come in the trials could not be stati@@ sfac@@ tor@@ ily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A system@@ atic revie@@ w has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials.
Met@@ a-@@ analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point esti@@ mate of 1.@@ 08 in favour of control@@ s (95% CI:
0.@@ 99@@ , 1,18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.@@ 67@@ , 95% CI:
1.@@ 35@@ , 2.@@ 06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin@@ .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcom@@ es might app@@ ly to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is uncle@@ ar because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data revie@@ we@@ d.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Intravenous route
Me@@ asure@@ ment of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volun@@ te@@ ers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
111 18 hours post@@ dose.
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20@@ th of the valu@@ e).
There is no accumul@@ ation: the levels remain the sa@@ me, whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection.
The half-life is diff@@ ic@@ ult to evalu@@ ate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some pre@@ clinical toxic@@ ological studies in do@@ gs and rats, but not in monke@@ ys, epoetin alfa therapy was associated with sub@@ clinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyper@@ parathy@@ ro@@ idis@@ m or unknown fac@@ tors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a mat@@ ched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa@@ .).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.
These changes are inter@@ pre@@ ted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacter@@ ial and ma@@ mm@@ al@@ ian cell cul@@ ture mutagenicity te@@ sts and an in vivo micronucleus test in mic@@ e.
Lon@@ g-term carcin@@ ogenicity studies have not been carried ou@@ t.
There are conf@@ lic@@ ting reports in the lit@@ erature reg@@ ar@@ ding whether erythropoietins may pla@@ y a major role as tumour prolifer@@ ator@@ s.
These reports are based on in vitro find@@ ings from human tumour samp@@ les, but are of unc@@ ertain significance in the clinical situ@@ ation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (C@@ RF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal orig@@ in accomp@@ anied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion require@@ ments in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphom@@ a or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-@@ existing anaemia at the start of chemotherap@@ y).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme@@ .
Its use in this indication must be bal@@ anced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb@@ ) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.@@ 1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency@@ ), if blood sa@@ ving procedu@@ res are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for fe@@ males or 5 or more units for mal@@ es).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to al@@ lo@@ gen@@ ei@@ c blood transfusions in adult non-@@ iron def@@ icient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perc@@ ei@@ ved risk for transfusion complications.
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initi@@ ated under the supervision of physici@@ ans experienced in the management of patients with the above indic@@ ations.
1@@ 14 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration ai@@ med for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provi@@ ded.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose manage@@ ment, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25@@ %.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level@@ .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other causes of anaemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be exclu@@ ded before insti@@ tut@@ ing therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cau@@ ses: iron, fol@@ ate, or vitamin B12 deficiency@@ ; aluminium intoxic@@ ation@@ ; inter@@ current infec@@ tion@@ s; inflamm@@ atory or tra@@ um@@ atic episode@@ s; oc@@ cul@@ t blood loss@@ ; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any orig@@ in.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of at least four weeks.
At each step@@ , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.@@ 75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
1@@ 15 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achie@@ ved.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
General@@ ly, children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adul@@ ts.
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment:
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usu@@ al maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equ@@ al injection@@ s.
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialy@@ sis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous rou@@ te, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg inc@@ rements (3 times per week@@ ) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four week@@ s).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemi@@ a:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
1@@ 16 avoide@@ d; gu@@ id@@ ance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values excee@@ ding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following dia@@ gram@@ :
11@@ 7 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
Tar@@ get Hb (appro@@ x.
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dis@@ continue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl@@ :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50@@ %.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme@@ :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of don@@ ating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedu@@ re.
Mil@@ dly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 - 39@@ %) requiring prede@@ posi@@ t of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.
200 mg oral ele@@ mental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous prede@@ posit@@ , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surger@@ y:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
1@@ 18 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three weeks (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In cases where there is a medical need to shor@@ ten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 con@@ sec@@ utive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.
When performing haemat@@ olog@@ ic assess@@ ments during the pre@@ operative period, if the haemoglobin level rea@@ ches 15 g/ dl, or high@@ er, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the out@@ set of the treatment patients are not iron def@@ icient.
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron sto@@ res.
Method of administration
Adminis@@ ter the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depen@@ ding on the total dose.
In haemo@@ dialy@@ sed patients, a bol@@ us injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous por@@ t in the dialysis lin@@ e.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistul@@ a needle tub@@ ing, followed by 10 ml of isoton@@ ic sal@@ ine to rin@@ se the tu@@ bing and ensure sati@@ sfac@@ tory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is prefer@@ able in patients who reac@@ t to the treatment with “ flu@@ -like@@ ” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be excee@@ ded.
In case of larger volume@@ s, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injections are given in the th@@ igh@@ s or the anter@@ ior abdominal wall@@ .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutane@@ ous@@ ly@@ !
The intravenous route has to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develo@@ p Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasi@@ a).
Un@@ controlled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous bloo@@ d”@@ : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month pre@@ ce@@ ding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reas@@ on cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylax@@ is.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe cor@@ onar@@ y, peripheral arter@@ ial, car@@ oti@@ d or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident@@ .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inade@@ qu@@ ately treated
It may be necessary to ad@@ d or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This reg@@ resses during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficienc@@ ie@@ s) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optim@@ um response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron stores should be as@@ sure@@ d:
200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally (100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transfer@@ rin sat@@ ur@@ ation is below 20%.
All of these addi@@ tive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when dec@@ iding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practic@@ es should always be used in the per@@ is@@ urg@@ ical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patients develop@@ ing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month@@ ) with increased need for transfusion@@ s, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typ@@ ical causes of non-@@ response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxic@@ ation, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemoly@@ sis@@ ) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ inde@@ x”@@ ) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ mic@@ rolit@@ re or < 0.@@ 5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal@@ , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been fo@@ und, anti-@@ erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examin@@ ation should be considered for dia@@ gno@@ sis of PRC@@ A.
If anti-@@ erythropoietin, anti@@ body-mediated PRCA is suspec@@ ted, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be com@@ men@@ ced because of the risk of cro@@ ss@@ -reaction.
Appro@@ priate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patients
Immun@@ ogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for anti@@ body-@@ induced PRC@@ A, i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not suff@@ icient.
Therefore, in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intraven@@ ously.
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Con@@ trol@@ led clinical trials have not shown significant benefits at@@ trib@@ ut@@ able to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avo@@ id blood transfusion@@ .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
12@@ 0 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension.
Hyper@@ kalaemia has been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intak@@ e.
Dialy@@ sis prescrip@@ tions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea@@ , creatin@@ ine and potassium in the desired range@@ .
Ser@@ um electroly@@ tes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or ris@@ ing) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ce@@ as@@ ing epoetin alfa administration until hyper@@ kalaemia has been correc@@ ted.
An increase in hep@@ ar@@ in dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occ@@ lu@@ sion of the dialysis system is possible if hep@@ arin@@ isation is not optim@@ um.
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically ev@@ id@@ ent ischaemic heart disease or con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to da@@ te, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accel@@ erate the rate of progression of renal insufficienc@@ y.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appe@@ arance of erythropoiet@@ in-@@ induced red cells should be taken into account when assess@@ ing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transf@@ use@@ d).
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)@@ m, the dose ad@@ ap@@ tation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (T@@ VE@@ s) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8@@ ), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa@@ ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embol@@ is@@ m).
An investig@@ ational study (BES@@ T study@@ ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was de@@ sign@@ ed to determin@@ e whether epoetin alfa treatment that exten@@ ded beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcom@@ es.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In vie@@ w of the abo@@ ve, in some clinical situ@@ ations blood transfusions should be the prefer@@ red treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.
The dec@@ is@@ ion to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benef@@ it@@ -risk assessment with the particip@@ ation of the individual patient@@ , which should also take into account the specific clinical con@@ tex@@ t.
Fac@@ tors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage@@ ; the de@@ gree of anaemi@@ a; life-@@ expec@@ tanc@@ y; the environ@@ ment in which the patient is being trea@@ te@@ d; and patient pre@@ feren@@ ce (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programme@@ s, especially routine volume replace@@ ment, should be respec@@ ted.
121 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thromboti@@ c events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylax@@ is, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special pre@@ caution should be taken in patients with pre@@ disposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT@@ s).
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tum@@ our growth potential
Erythropoietin@@ s are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth fac@@ tors, there is a conc@@ ern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tum@@ ours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have sho@@ wn@@ :
- decreased lo@@ co@@ region@@ al control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.@@ 7 mmol/ l),
- shor@@ ten@@ ed overall survival and increased deaths at@@ tribu@@ ted to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving nei@@ ther chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESA@@ s are not indicated for use in this patient popul@@ ation.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essen@@ tially “ sodi@@ um@@ - fre@@ e”@@ .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alter@@ s the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an inter@@ action.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclo@@ spor@@ in, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit ris@@ es.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differenti@@ ation or prolifer@@ ation of tumour bi@@ op@@ sy spec@@ im@@ ens in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproduc@@ tion toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequent@@ ly:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit out@@ weigh@@ s the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lact@@ ating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
program@@ me, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hyperten@@ sive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur.
At@@ tention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
General
Non-@@ specific skin rash@@ es have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu@@ -like@@ " symptoms such as headach@@ es, joint pain@@ s, feelings of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thromb@@ oc@@ yto@@ sis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thromboti@@ c/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemi@@ a, myocardial infarc@@ tion, cerebrovascular acc@@ id@@ ents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarc@@ tion), transient ischaemic attack@@ s, deep vein thrombosis, arter@@ ial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli@@ , aneurysms, re@@ tinal thrombosis, and clo@@ tting of an ar@@ tif@@ ic@@ ial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythro@@ blastopen@@ ia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed (see sections 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasi@@ a)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressu@@ re: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e. g. headaches and conf@@ used st@@ ate) and gener@@ alised ton@@ oc@@ lon@@ al seizu@@ res, requiring the im@@ mediate attention of a physician and inten@@ sive medical ca@@ re.
Parti@@ cular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migra@@ ine@@ - like headaches as a possible warning signal.
Sh@@ unt thrombo@@ ses may occur, especially in patients who have a ten@@ den@@ cy to hypotension or whose arter@@ io@@ venous fistul@@ ae ex@@ hibit complications (e. g. sten@@ oses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early sh@@ unt revision and thrombosis prophylax@@ is by administration of ac@@ etylsalic@@ ylic acid, for ex@@ amp@@ le, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hyperten@@ sion may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequent@@ ly, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
12@@ 3 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General@@ ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
Sur@@ ger@@ y patients in autologous predonation program@@ mes
In@@ dependent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotom@@ y.
Therefore, routine volume replace@@ ment should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVT@@ s), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group@@ , although the clinical experience is limit@@ ed.
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic mar@@ gin of epoetin alfa is very wide@@ .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are exten@@ sions of the pharmacological effects of the hormon@@ e.
Phlebotom@@ y may be performed if exces@@ sively high haemoglobin levels occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: anti@@ anaemi@@ c, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glyco@@ protein that stimul@@ ates, as a mito@@ sis-stimulating factor and differenti@@ ating hormon@@ e, the formation of erythrocy@@ tes from pre@@ cur@@ sor@@ s of the stem cell compar@@ tment.
The apparent molec@@ ular weight of erythropoietin is 32,@@ 000 to 40,000 dal@@ ton.
The protein fra@@ ction of the molec@@ ule con@@ tribu@@ tes about 58% and consis@@ ts of 165 amino acid@@ s.
The four carbohydrate chains are attach@@ ed via three N-@@ glycosidic bon@@ ds and one O-@@ glycosidic bond to the protein@@ .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is iden@@ tical in its amino acid and carbohydrate com@@ position to endogen@@ ous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed has the highest possible pur@@ ity according to the pres@@ ent state of the ar@@ t.
In particul@@ ar, no resi@@ du@@ es of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, poly@@ cy@@ th@@ aemi@@ c mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocy@@ tes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59@@ Fe-@@ incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-@@ thy@@ mid@@ ine incorporation in the erythro@@ id nucle@@ ated spleen cells has been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell cultu@@ re) after inc@@ ubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultu@@ res of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leu@@ co@@ po@@ ie@@ sis.
Cyto@@ toxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detec@@ ted.
12@@ 4 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-@@ Hodgkin@@ 's lymphom@@ a, and 24 other haematological malignancie@@ s) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 pro@@ state, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour typ@@ es).
In two lar@@ ge, open-label studies, 26@@ 97 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were include@@ d, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour typ@@ es) and 802 with haematological malignancie@@ s.
In a pro@@ spec@@ tiv@@ e, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-@@ myelo@@ id malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemi@@ a-related sequelae (e. g. fatigu@@ e, decreased energy, and activity reduc@@ tion), as measured by the following instrum@@ ents and scal@@ es:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therap@@ y- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other sm@@ all@@ er, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in qual@@ ity of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLA@@ S, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examin@@ ed in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blin@@ d placebo-controlled studies and one was an open@@ - label study.
The studies either rec@@ ru@@ it@@ ed patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studi@@ es) or used patient popul@@ ations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indic@@ ate@@ d: anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radio@@ therapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl@@ ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratio@@ s for overall survival range@@ d between 1.@@ 25 and 2.@@ 47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown an consis@@ tent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common canc@@ ers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Over@@ all survival out@@ come in the trials could not be stati@@ sfac@@ tor@@ ily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A system@@ atic revie@@ w has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials.
Met@@ a-@@ analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point esti@@ mate of 1.@@ 08 in favour of control@@ s (95% CI:
0.@@ 99@@ , 1,18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.@@ 67@@ , 95% CI:
1.@@ 35@@ , 2.@@ 06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin@@ .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcom@@ es might app@@ ly to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is uncle@@ ar because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data revie@@ we@@ d.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Intravenous route
Me@@ asure@@ ment of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volun@@ te@@ ers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
125 18 hours post@@ dose.
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20@@ th of the valu@@ e).
There is no accumul@@ ation: the levels remain the sa@@ me, whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection.
The half-life is diff@@ ic@@ ult to evalu@@ ate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some pre@@ clinical toxic@@ ological studies in do@@ gs and rats, but not in monke@@ ys, epoetin alfa therapy was associated with sub@@ clinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyper@@ parathy@@ ro@@ idis@@ m or unknown fac@@ tors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a mat@@ ched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa@@ .).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.
These changes are inter@@ pre@@ ted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacter@@ ial and ma@@ mm@@ al@@ ian cell cul@@ ture mutagenicity te@@ sts and an in vivo micronucleus test in mic@@ e.
Lon@@ g-term carcin@@ ogenicity studies have not been carried ou@@ t.
There are conf@@ lic@@ ting reports in the lit@@ erature reg@@ ar@@ ding whether erythropoietins may pla@@ y a major role as tumour prolifer@@ ator@@ s.
These reports are based on in vitro find@@ ings from human tumour samp@@ les, but are of unc@@ ertain significance in the clinical situ@@ ation.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia associated with chronic renal failure (C@@ RF) in adult and paediatric patients:
- Treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure in paediatric and adult patients on
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (See section 4.4).
- Treatment of severe anaemia of renal orig@@ in accomp@@ anied by clinical symptoms in adult patients
with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (See section 4.4).
Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion require@@ ments in adult patients receiving chemotherapy for solid tumours, malignant lymphom@@ a or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as assessed by the patient's general status (e. g. cardiovascular status, pre-@@ existing anaemia at the start of chemotherap@@ y).
Abseamed can be used to increase the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme@@ .
Its use in this indication must be bal@@ anced against the reported risk of thromboembolic events.
Treatment should only be given to patients with moderate anaemia (haemoglobin (Hb@@ ) 10 – 13 g/ dl [6.2 – 8.@@ 1 mmol/ l], no iron deficiency@@ ), if blood sa@@ ving procedu@@ res are not available or insufficient when the scheduled major elective surgery requires a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood for fe@@ males or 5 or more units for mal@@ es).
Abseamed can be used to reduce exposure to al@@ lo@@ gen@@ ei@@ c blood transfusions in adult non-@@ iron def@@ icient patients prior to major elective orthopaedic surgery, having a high perc@@ ei@@ ved risk for transfusion complications.
Use should be restricted to patients with moderate anaemia (e. g.
Hb 10 - 13 g/ dl) who do not have an autologous predonation programme available and with an expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
Treatment with Abseamed has to be initi@@ ated under the supervision of physici@@ ans experienced in the management of patients with the above indic@@ ations.
12@@ 8 Posology
Treatment of symptomatic anaemia in adult and paediatric chronic renal failure patients:
In patients with chronic renal failure the medicinal product has to be administered intravenously (see section 4.4).
The haemoglobin concentration ai@@ med for is between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l), except in paediatric patients in whom the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Abseamed should be administered intravenously in order to increase haemoglobin to not greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A rise in haemoglobin of greater than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) over a four week period should be avoided.
If it occurs, appropriate dose adjustments should be made as provi@@ ded.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose manage@@ ment, with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
In paediatric patients the recommended target haemoglobin range is between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be avoided.
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the sustained haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) reduce the epoetin alfa dose by 25@@ %.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and then reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous level@@ .
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of anaemia and of the symptoms of anaemia.
Iron status should be evaluated prior to and during treatment and iron supplementation administered if necessary.
In addition, other causes of anaemia, such as vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be exclu@@ ded before insti@@ tut@@ ing therapy with epoetin alfa.
Non response to epoetin alfa therapy may have the following cau@@ ses: iron, fol@@ ate, or vitamin B12 deficiency@@ ; aluminium intoxic@@ ation@@ ; inter@@ current infec@@ tion@@ s; inflamm@@ atory or tra@@ um@@ atic episode@@ s; oc@@ cul@@ t blood loss@@ ; haemolysis, and bone marrow fibrosis of any orig@@ in.
Adult haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of at least four weeks.
At each step@@ , the increase or reduction in dose should be of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
The recommended total weekly dose is between 75 and 300 IU/ kg given by the intravenous route.
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6 g/ dl or< 3.@@ 75 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 8 g/dl or> 5 mmol/l).
Paediatric haemodialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
12@@ 9 Correction phase:
50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
When a dose adjustment is necessary, this should be done in steps of 25 IU/ kg 3 times per week at intervals of at least 4 weeks until the desired goal is achie@@ ved.
Maintenance phase:
Hb between 9.5 and 11 g/ dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol/ l).
General@@ ly, children under 30 kg require higher maintenance doses than children over 30 kg and adul@@ ts.
The following maintenance doses were observed in clinical trials after 6 months of treatment:
Weight (kg )< 10 10 - 30 > 30
Median 100 75 33
Usu@@ al maintenance dose 75 - 150 60 - 150 30 - 100
The clinical data available suggest that those patients whose initial haemoglobin is very low (< 6.8 g/ dl or< 4.25 mmol/l) may require higher maintenance doses than those whose initial anaemia is less severe (Hb > 6.8 g/dl or> 4.25 mmol/l).
Adult peritoneal dialysis patients:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week by the intravenous route.
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 25 and 50 IU/ kg 2 times per week into 2 equ@@ al injection@@ s.
Adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialy@@ sis:
The treatment is divided into two stages:
Correction phase:
Starting dose of 50 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous rou@@ te, followed if necessary by a dose increase with 25 IU/ kg inc@@ rements (3 times per week@@ ) until the desired goal is achieved (this should be done in steps of at least four week@@ s).
Maintenance phase:
Dose adjustment in order to maintain haemoglobin values at the desired level:
Hb between 10 and 12 g/ dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol/ l).
Maintenance dose between 17 and 33 IU/ kg 3 times per week by the intravenous route.
The maximum dose should not exceed 200 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemi@@ a:
Epoetin alfa should be administered by the subcutaneous route to patients with anaemia (e. g. haemoglobin concentration ≤ 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l).
Anaemia symptoms and sequelae may vary with age, gender, and overall burden of disease; a physician´s evaluation of the individual patient´s clinical course and condition is necessary.
Due to intra-patient variability, occasional individual haemoglobin values for a patient above and below the desired haemoglobin level may be observed.
Haemoglobin variability should be addressed through dose management with consideration for the haemoglobin target range of 10 g/ dl (6.2 mmol/ l) to 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
A sustained haemoglobin level of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) should be
1@@ 30 avoide@@ d; gu@@ id@@ ance for appropriate dose adjustment for when haemoglobin values excee@@ ding 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) are observed are described below.
Patients should be monitored closely to ensure that the lowest approved dose of Epoetin alfa is used to provide adequate control of the symptoms of anaemia.
Epoetin alfa therapy should continue until one month after the end of chemotherapy.
The initial dose is 150 IU/ kg given subcutaneously 3 times per week.
Alternatively, epoetin alfa can be administered at an initial dose of 450 IU/ kg subcutaneously once weekly.
If haemoglobin has increased by at least 1 g/ dl (0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline after 4 weeks of treatment, the dose should remain at 150 IU/ kg 3 times a week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly.
If the haemoglobin increase is < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, increase the dose to 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
If after an additional 4 weeks of therapy at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week, the haemoglobin has increased ≥ 1 g/ dl (≥ 0.62 mmol/ l) or the reticulocyte count has increased ≥ 40,000 cells/ µl the dose should remain at 300 IU/ kg 3 times per week.
However, if the haemoglobin has increased < 1 g/ dl (< 0.62 mmol/ l) and the reticulocyte count has increased < 40,000 cells/ µl above baseline, response to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and treatment should be discontinued.
The recommended dosing regimen is described in the following dia@@ gram@@ :
13@@ 1 150 IU/ kg 3x/ week or 450 IU/ kg once weekly
for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl
Tar@@ get Hb (appro@@ x.
12 g/ dl)
300 IU/ kg 3x/ week for 4 weeks
Reticulocyte count increase ≥ 40,000/ µl or Hb increase ≥ 1 g/ dl
Reticulocyte count increase < 40,000/ µl and Hb increase < 1 g/ dl
Dis@@ continue therapy
Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl@@ :
If the haemoglobin is rising by more than 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month, or if the haemoglobin exceeds 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l), the dose should be reduced by approximately 25 to 50@@ %.
If the haemoglobin exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l), discontinue therapy until it falls below 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) and than reinstitute epoetin alfa therapy at a dose 25% below the previous dose.
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme@@ :
Abseamed should be given by the intravenous route.
At the time of don@@ ating blood, Abseamed should be administered after the completion of the blood donation procedu@@ re.
Mil@@ dly anaemic patients (haematocrit of 33 - 39@@ %) requiring prede@@ posi@@ t of ≥ 4 units of blood should be treated with Abseamed at a dose of 600 IU/ kg body weight 2 times weekly for 3 weeks prior to surgery.
200 mg oral ele@@ mental iron daily) throughout the course of treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started as soon as possible, even several weeks prior to initiating the autologous prede@@ posit@@ , in order to achieve high iron stores prior to starting Abseamed therapy.
Treatment of adult patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surger@@ y:
The subcutaneous route of administration should be used.
13@@ 2 The recommended dose is 600 IU/ kg epoetin alfa, given weekly for three weeks (days 21, 14 and 7) prior to surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).
In cases where there is a medical need to shor@@ ten the lead time before surgery to less than three weeks, 300 IU/ kg epoetin alfa should be given daily for 10 con@@ sec@@ utive days prior to surgery, on the day of surgery and for four days immediately thereafter.
When performing haemat@@ olog@@ ic assess@@ ments during the pre@@ operative period, if the haemoglobin level rea@@ ches 15 g/ dl, or high@@ er, administration of epoetin alfa should be stopped and further doses should not be given.
Care should be taken to ensure that at the out@@ set of the treatment patients are not iron def@@ icient.
All patients being treated with epoetin alfa should receive adequate iron supplementation (e. g. oral iron substitution of 200 mg Fe2+ daily) throughout the course of epoetin alfa treatment.
Iron supplementation should be started prior to epoetin alfa therapy, to achieve adequate iron sto@@ res.
Method of administration
Adminis@@ ter the amount required.
This medicinal product must not be administered by intravenous infusion, or mixed with other medicinal products.
1.
Intravenous injection: over at least one to five minutes, depen@@ ding on the total dose.
In haemo@@ dialy@@ sed patients, a bol@@ us injection may be given during the dialysis session through a suitable venous por@@ t in the dialysis lin@@ e.
Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis session via the fistul@@ a needle tub@@ ing, followed by 10 ml of isoton@@ ic sal@@ ine to rin@@ se the tu@@ bing and ensure sati@@ sfac@@ tory injection of the product into the circulation.
A slower injection is prefer@@ able in patients who reac@@ t to the treatment with “ flu@@ -like@@ ” symptoms.
2.
Subcutaneous injection: a maximum volume of 1 ml at one injection site should generally not be excee@@ ded.
In case of larger volume@@ s, more than one site should be chosen for the injection.
The injections are given in the th@@ igh@@ s or the anter@@ ior abdominal wall@@ .
In chronic renal failure patients Abseamed has not to be administered subcutane@@ ous@@ ly@@ !
The intravenous route has to be used (please see section 4.4 - chronic renal failure patients).
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.
Patients who develo@@ p Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) following treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive Abseamed or any other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - Pure Red Cell Aplasi@@ a).
Un@@ controlled hypertension.
In the indication “ increasing the yield of autologous bloo@@ d”@@ : myocardial infarction or stroke in the month pre@@ ce@@ ding treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis such as history of venous thromboembolic disease.
Patients who for any reas@@ on cannot receive adequate antithrombotic prophylax@@ is.
The use of epoetin alfa in patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery and not participating in an autologous blood predonation programme is contraindicated in patients with severe cor@@ onar@@ y, peripheral arter@@ ial, car@@ oti@@ d or cerebral vascular disease, including patients with recent myocardial infarction or cerebral vascular accident@@ .
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
General
In all patients receiving epoetin alfa, blood pressure should be closely monitored and controlled as necessary.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inade@@ qu@@ ately treated
It may be necessary to ad@@ d or increase antihypertensive treatment.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, epoetin alfa treatment should be discontinued.
Epoetin alfa should be used with caution in the presence of epilepsy and chronic liver failure.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent rise in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with epoetin alfa.
This reg@@ resses during the course of continued therapy.
It is recommended that the platelet count is regularly monitored during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia (iron deficiency, haemolysis, blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficienc@@ ie@@ s) should be considered and treated prior to initiating therapy with epoetin alfa.
In most cases, the ferritin values in the serum fall simultaneously with the rise in packed cell volume.
In order to ensure optim@@ um response to epoetin alfa, adequate iron stores should be as@@ sure@@ d:
200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day orally (100 - 200 mg Fe2+/ day for paediatric
patients) is recommended for chronic renal failure patients whose serum ferritin levels are below 100 ng/ ml
- oral iron substitution of 200 - 300 mg Fe2+/ day is recommended for all cancer patients whose
transfer@@ rin sat@@ ur@@ ation is below 20%.
All of these addi@@ tive factors of anaemia should also be carefully considered when dec@@ iding to increase the dose of epoetin alfa in cancer patients.
Good blood management practic@@ es should always be used in the per@@ is@@ urg@@ ical setting
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA) Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported after months to years of subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment.
In patients develop@@ ing sudden lack of efficacy defined by a decrease in haemoglobin (1 to 2 g/ dl per month@@ ) with increased need for transfusion@@ s, a reticulocyte count should be obtained and typ@@ ical causes of non-@@ response (e. g. iron, folate or, vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium intoxic@@ ation, infection or inflammation, blood loss and haemoly@@ sis@@ ) should be investigated.
If the reticulocyte count corrected for anaemia (i. e., the reticulocyte “ inde@@ x”@@ ) is low (< 20,000/ mm3 or < 20,000/ mic@@ rolit@@ re or < 0.@@ 5%), platelet and white blood cell counts are normal@@ , and if no other cause of loss of effect has been fo@@ und, anti-@@ erythropoietin antibodies should be determined and bone marrow examin@@ ation should be considered for dia@@ gno@@ sis of PRC@@ A.
If anti-@@ erythropoietin, anti@@ body-mediated PRCA is suspec@@ ted, therapy with Abseamed should be discontinued immediately.
No other erythropoietic therapy should be com@@ men@@ ced because of the risk of cro@@ ss@@ -reaction.
Appro@@ priate therapy such as blood transfusions may be given to patients when indicated.
Chronic renal failure patients
Immun@@ ogenicity data for subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients at risk for anti@@ body-@@ induced PRC@@ A, i. e. patients with renal anaemia, are not suff@@ icient.
Therefore, in patients with renal anaemia the medicinal product has to be administered intraven@@ ously.
In patients with chronic renal failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration recommended in section 4.2.
In clinical trials, an increased risk of death and serious cardiovascular events was observed when erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs) were administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l).
Con@@ trol@@ led clinical trials have not shown significant benefits at@@ trib@@ ut@@ able to the administration of epoetins when haemoglobin concentration is increased beyond the level necessary to control symptoms of anaemia and to avo@@ id blood transfusion@@ .
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
The rate of increase in haemoglobin should be approximately 1 g/ dl
13@@ 4 (0.62 mmol/ l) per month and should not exceed 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month to minimise risks of an increase in hypertension.
Hyper@@ kalaemia has been observed in isolated cases.
Correction for anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and potassium and protein intak@@ e.
Dialy@@ sis prescrip@@ tions may have to be adjusted periodically to maintain urea@@ , creatin@@ ine and potassium in the desired range@@ .
Ser@@ um electroly@@ tes should be monitored in chronic renal failure patients.
If an elevated (or ris@@ ing) serum potassium level is detected then consideration should be given to ce@@ as@@ ing epoetin alfa administration until hyper@@ kalaemia has been correc@@ ted.
An increase in hep@@ ar@@ in dose during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with epoetin alfa as a result of the increased packed cell volume.
Occ@@ lu@@ sion of the dialysis system is possible if hep@@ arin@@ isation is not optim@@ um.
In patients with chronic renal failure and clinically ev@@ id@@ ent ischaemic heart disease or con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart failure, maintenance haemoglobin concentration should not exceed the upper limit of the target haemoglobin concentration as recommended under section 4.2.
Based on information available to da@@ te, correction of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis does not accel@@ erate the rate of progression of renal insufficienc@@ y.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
In cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, the 2 - 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appe@@ arance of erythropoiet@@ in-@@ induced red cells should be taken into account when assess@@ ing if epoetin alfa therapy is appropriate (patient at risk of being transf@@ use@@ d).
Haemoglobin levels should be measured on a regular basis until a stable level is achieved and periodically thereafter.
If the rate of increase in haemoglobin exceeds 2 g/ dl (1.25 mmol/ l) per month or the haemoglobin level exceeds 13 g/ dl (8.1 mmol/ l)@@ m, the dose ad@@ ap@@ tation detailed in section 4.2 should be thoroughly performed to minimise the risk for thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy induced anaemia - Dosage adjustment to maintain haemoglobin concentration between 10 g/ dl - 12 g/ dl).
As an increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (T@@ VE@@ s) has been observed in cancer patients receiving erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (see section 4.8@@ ), this risk should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from treatment (with epoetin alfa@@ ) particularly in cancer patients with an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, such as obesity and patients with a prior history of TVEs (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embol@@ is@@ m).
An investig@@ ational study (BES@@ T study@@ ) in women with metastatic breast cancer was de@@ sign@@ ed to determin@@ e whether epoetin alfa treatment that exten@@ ded beyond the correction of anaemia could improve treatment outcom@@ es.
In that study the incidence of fatal thromboembolic events was higher in patients receiving epoetin alfa than in those receiving placebo (see section 5.1).
In vie@@ w of the abo@@ ve, in some clinical situ@@ ations blood transfusions should be the prefer@@ red treatment for the management of anaemia in patients with cancer.
The dec@@ is@@ ion to administer recombinant erythropoietins should be based on a benef@@ it@@ -risk assessment with the particip@@ ation of the individual patient@@ , which should also take into account the specific clinical con@@ tex@@ t.
Fac@@ tors that should be considered in this assessment should include the type of tumour and its stage@@ ; the de@@ gree of anaemi@@ a; life-@@ expec@@ tanc@@ y; the environ@@ ment in which the patient is being trea@@ te@@ d; and patient pre@@ feren@@ ce (see section 5.1).
Adult surgery patients in an autologous predonation programme
All special warnings and precautions associated with autologous predonation programme@@ s, especially routine volume replace@@ ment, should be respec@@ ted.
13@@ 5 Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of epoetin alfa treatment.
Thromboti@@ c events can be a risk in this population and this possibility should be carefully weighed against the benefit to be derived from the treatment in this patient group.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate antithrombotic prophylax@@ is, as thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients, especially in those with underlying cardiovascular disease.
In addition, special pre@@ caution should be taken in patients with pre@@ disposition for development of deep vein thrombosis (DVT@@ s).
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
Therefore, it should not be used in patients with baseline haemoglobin > 13 g/ dl.
Tum@@ our growth potential
Erythropoietin@@ s are growth factors that primarily stimulate red blood cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
As with all growth fac@@ tors, there is a conc@@ ern that epoetins could stimulate the growth of tum@@ ours.
In several controlled studies, epoetins have not been shown to improve overall survival or decrease the risk of tumour progression in patients with anaemia associated with cancer.
In controlled clinical studies, use of Epoetin alfa and other erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) have sho@@ wn@@ :
- decreased lo@@ co@@ region@@ al control in patients with advanced head and neck cancer receiving
radiation therapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of greater than 14 g/ dl (8.@@ 7 mmol/ l),
- shor@@ ten@@ ed overall survival and increased deaths at@@ tribu@@ ted to disease progression at 4 months in
patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving chemotherapy when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 - 14 g/ dl (7.5 – 8.7 mmol/ l),
- increased risk of death when administered to target a haemoglobin of 12 g/ dl (7.5 mmol/ l) in
patients with active malignant disease receiving nei@@ ther chemotherapy nor radiation therapy.
ESA@@ s are not indicated for use in this patient popul@@ ation.
Excipients
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i. e. essen@@ tially “ sodi@@ um@@ - fre@@ e”@@ .
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No evidence exists that indicates that treatment with epoetin alfa alter@@ s the metabolism of other medicinal products.
However, since cyclosporin is bound by red blood cells there is potential for an inter@@ action.
If epoetin alfa is given concomitantly with cyclo@@ spor@@ in, blood levels of cyclosporin should be monitored and the dose of cyclosporin adjusted as the haematocrit ris@@ es.
No evidence exists that indicates an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF with regard to haematological differenti@@ ation or prolifer@@ ation of tumour bi@@ op@@ sy spec@@ im@@ ens in vitro.
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women.
Studies in animals have shown reproduc@@ tion toxicity (see section 5.3).
Consequent@@ ly:
- In chronic renal failure patients, epoetin alfa should be used in pregnancy only if the potential
benefit out@@ weigh@@ s the potential risk to the foetus.
- In pregnant or lact@@ ating surgical patients participating in an autologous blood predonation
program@@ me, the use of epoetin alfa is not recommended.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Abseamed has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
The most frequent adverse reaction is an increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
Hyperten@@ sive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms can occur.
At@@ tention should be paid to sudden stabbing migraine-like headaches as a possible warning signal.
General
Non-@@ specific skin rash@@ es have been described in association with epoetin alfa.
"Flu@@ -like@@ " symptoms such as headach@@ es, joint pain@@ s, feelings of weakness, dizziness, and tiredness may occur, especially at the start of treatment.
Thromb@@ oc@@ yto@@ sis has been observed but its occurrence is very rare (see section 4.4).
Thromboti@@ c/ vascular events, such as myocardial ischaemi@@ a, myocardial infarc@@ tion, cerebrovascular acc@@ id@@ ents (cerebral haemorrhage and cerebral infarc@@ tion), transient ischaemic attack@@ s, deep vein thrombosis, arter@@ ial thrombosis, pulmonary emboli@@ , aneurysms, re@@ tinal thrombosis, and clo@@ tting of an ar@@ tif@@ ic@@ ial kidney have been reported in patients receiving erythropoietic agents, including patients receiving epoetin alfa.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been rarely reported with epoetin alfa including isolated cases of angioedema and anaphylactic reaction.
Antibody-mediated erythro@@ blastopen@@ ia (PRCA) has been reported after months to years of treatment with epoetin alfa.
In most of these patients, antibodies to erythropoietins have been observed (see sections 4.3 and 4.4 – Pure Red Cell Aplasi@@ a)
Adult and paediatric haemodialysis patients, adult peritoneal dialysis patients and adult patients with renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis
The most frequent adverse reaction during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or aggravation of existing hypertension.
These increases in blood pressure can be treated with medicinal products.
Moreover, monitoring of the blood pressure is recommended particularly at the start of therapy.
The following reactions have also occurred in isolated patients with normal or low blood pressu@@ re: hypertensive crisis with encephalopathy-like symptoms (e. g. headaches and conf@@ used st@@ ate) and gener@@ alised ton@@ oc@@ lon@@ al seizu@@ res, requiring the im@@ mediate attention of a physician and inten@@ sive medical ca@@ re.
Parti@@ cular attention should be paid to sudden stabbing migra@@ ine@@ - like headaches as a possible warning signal.
Sh@@ unt thrombo@@ ses may occur, especially in patients who have a ten@@ den@@ cy to hypotension or whose arter@@ io@@ venous fistul@@ ae ex@@ hibit complications (e. g. sten@@ oses, aneurysms, etc.).
Early sh@@ unt revision and thrombosis prophylax@@ is by administration of ac@@ etylsalic@@ ylic acid, for ex@@ amp@@ le, is recommended in these patients.
Adult cancer patients with symptomatic anaemia receiving chemotherapy
Hyperten@@ sion may occur in epoetin alfa treated patients.
Consequent@@ ly, haemoglobin and blood pressure should be closely monitored.
13@@ 7 An increased incidence of thrombotic vascular events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General@@ ) has been observed in patients receiving erythropoietic agents.
Sur@@ ger@@ y patients in autologous predonation program@@ mes
In@@ dependent of erythropoietin treatment, thrombotic and vascular events may occur in surgical patients with underlying cardiovascular disease following repeated phlebotom@@ y.
Therefore, routine volume replace@@ ment should be performed in such patients.
Patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery
In patients scheduled for major elective orthopaedic surgery, with a baseline haemoglobin of 10 to 13 g/ dl, the incidence of thrombotic/ vascular events (most of which were DVT@@ s), in the overall patient population of the clinical trials, appeared to be similar across the different epoetin alfa dosing groups and placebo group@@ , although the clinical experience is limit@@ ed.
Moreover, in patients with a baseline haemoglobin of > 13 g/ dl, the possibility that epoetin alfa treatment may be associated with an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic/ vascular events cannot be excluded.
4.9 Overdose
The therapeutic mar@@ gin of epoetin alfa is very wide@@ .
Overdose of epoetin alfa may produce effects that are exten@@ sions of the pharmacological effects of the hormon@@ e.
Phlebotom@@ y may be performed if exces@@ sively high haemoglobin levels occur.
Additional supportive care should be provided as necessary.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: anti@@ anaemi@@ c, ATC code:
B03XA01
Erythropoietin is a glyco@@ protein that stimul@@ ates, as a mito@@ sis-stimulating factor and differenti@@ ating hormon@@ e, the formation of erythrocy@@ tes from pre@@ cur@@ sor@@ s of the stem cell compar@@ tment.
The apparent molec@@ ular weight of erythropoietin is 32,@@ 000 to 40,000 dal@@ ton.
The protein fra@@ ction of the molec@@ ule con@@ tribu@@ tes about 58% and consis@@ ts of 165 amino acid@@ s.
The four carbohydrate chains are attach@@ ed via three N-@@ glycosidic bon@@ ds and one O-@@ glycosidic bond to the protein@@ .
Epoetin alfa obtained by gene technology is glycosylated and is iden@@ tical in its amino acid and carbohydrate com@@ position to endogen@@ ous human erythropoietin that has been isolated from the urine of anaemic patients.
Abseamed has the highest possible pur@@ ity according to the pres@@ ent state of the ar@@ t.
In particul@@ ar, no resi@@ du@@ es of the cell line used for the production are detectable at the concentrations of the active ingredient that are used in humans.
The biological efficacy of epoetin alfa has been demonstrated in various animal models in vivo (normal and anaemic rats, poly@@ cy@@ th@@ aemi@@ c mice).
After administration of epoetin alfa, the number of erythrocy@@ tes, the Hb values and reticulocyte counts increase as well as the 59@@ Fe-@@ incorporation rate.
An increased 3H-@@ thy@@ mid@@ ine incorporation in the erythro@@ id nucle@@ ated spleen cells has been found in vitro (mouse spleen cell cultu@@ re) after inc@@ ubation with epoetin alfa.
It could be shown with the aid of cell cultu@@ res of human bone marrow cells that epoetin alfa stimulates erythropoiesis specifically and does not affect leu@@ co@@ po@@ ie@@ sis.
Cyto@@ toxic actions of epoetin alfa on bone marrow cells could not be detec@@ ted.
13@@ 8 721 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were included in three placebo-controlled studies, 389 patients with haematological malignancies (221 multiple myeloma, 144 non-@@ Hodgkin@@ 's lymphom@@ a, and 24 other haematological malignancie@@ s) and 332 with solid tumours (172 breast, 64 gynaecological, 23 lung, 22 pro@@ state, 21 gastro-intestinal, and 30 other tumour typ@@ es).
In two lar@@ ge, open-label studies, 26@@ 97 cancer patients receiving non-platinum chemotherapy were include@@ d, 1895 with solid tumours (683 breast, 260 lung, 174 gynaecological, 300 gastro-intestinal, and 478 other tumour typ@@ es) and 802 with haematological malignancie@@ s.
In a pro@@ spec@@ tiv@@ e, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in 375 anaemic patients with various non-@@ myelo@@ id malignancies receiving non-platinum chemotherapy, there was a significant reduction of anaemi@@ a-related sequelae (e. g. fatigu@@ e, decreased energy, and activity reduc@@ tion), as measured by the following instrum@@ ents and scal@@ es:
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therap@@ y- Anaemia (FACT-An) general scale, FACT-An fatigue scale, and Cancer Linear Analogue Scale (CLAS).
Two other sm@@ all@@ er, randomised, placebo-controlled trials failed to show a significant improvement in qual@@ ity of life parameters on the EORTC-QLQ-C30 scale or CLA@@ S, respectively.
Erythropoietin is a growth factor that primarily stimulates red cell production.
Erythropoietin receptors may be expressed on the surface of a variety of tumour cells.
Survival and tumour progression have been examin@@ ed in five large controlled studies involving a total of 2833 patients, of which four were double-blin@@ d placebo-controlled studies and one was an open@@ - label study.
The studies either rec@@ ru@@ it@@ ed patients who were being treated with chemotherapy (two studi@@ es) or used patient popul@@ ations in which erythropoiesis stimulating agents are not indic@@ ate@@ d: anaemia in patients with cancer not receiving chemotherapy, and head and neck cancer patients receiving radio@@ therapy.
The target haemoglobin concentration in two studies was > 13 g/ dl@@ ; in the remaining three studies it was 12 - 14 g/ dl.
In the open-label study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and controls.
In the four placebo-controlled studies the hazard ratio@@ s for overall survival range@@ d between 1.@@ 25 and 2.@@ 47 in favour of controls.
These studies have shown an consis@@ tent unexplained statistically significant excess mortality in patients who have anaemia associated with various common canc@@ ers who received recombinant human erythropoietin compared to controls.
Over@@ all survival out@@ come in the trials could not be stati@@ sfac@@ tor@@ ily explained by differences in the incidence of thrombosis and related complications between those given recombinant human erythropoietin and those in the control group.
A system@@ atic revie@@ w has also been performed involving more than 9000 cancer patients participating in 57 clinical trials.
Met@@ a-@@ analysis of overall survival data produced a hazard ratio point esti@@ mate of 1.@@ 08 in favour of control@@ s (95% CI:
0.@@ 99@@ , 1,18; 42 trials and 8167 patients).
An increased relative risk of thromboembolic events (RR 1.@@ 67@@ , 95% CI:
1.@@ 35@@ , 2.@@ 06, 35 trials and 6769 patients) was observed in patients treated with recombinant human erythropoietin@@ .
There is an increased risk for thromboembolic events in patients with cancer treated with recombinant human erythropoietin and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded.
The extent to which these outcom@@ es might app@@ ly to the administration of recombinant human erythropoietin to patients with cancer, treated with chemotherapy to achieve haemoglobin concentrations less than 13 g/ dl, is uncle@@ ar because few patients with these characteristics were included in the data revie@@ we@@ d.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Intravenous route
Me@@ asure@@ ment of epoetin alfa following multiple dose intravenous administration revealed a half-life of approximately 4 hours in normal volun@@ te@@ ers and a somewhat more prolonged half-life in renal failure patients, approximately 5 hours.
A half-life of approximately 6 hours has been reported in children.
Subcutaneous route
Following subcutaneous injection, serum levels of epoetin alfa are much lower than the levels achieved following intravenous injection, the levels increase slowly and reach a peak between 12 and
13@@ 9 18 hours post@@ dose.
The peak is always well below the peak achieved using the intravenous route (approximately 1/ 20@@ th of the valu@@ e).
There is no accumul@@ ation: the levels remain the sa@@ me, whether they are determined 24 hours after the first injection or 24 hours after the last injection.
The half-life is diff@@ ic@@ ult to evalu@@ ate for the subcutaneous route and is estimated about 24 hours.
The bioavailability of subcutaneous injectable epoetin alfa is much lower than that of the intravenous medicinal product: approximately 20%.
5.3 Preclinical safety data
In some pre@@ clinical toxic@@ ological studies in do@@ gs and rats, but not in monke@@ ys, epoetin alfa therapy was associated with sub@@ clinical bone marrow fibrosis (bone marrow fibrosis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic renal failure in humans and may be related to secondary hyper@@ parathy@@ ro@@ idis@@ m or unknown fac@@ tors.
The incidence of bone marrow fibrosis was not increased in a study of haemodialysis patients who were treated with epoetin alfa for 3 years compared to a mat@@ ched control group of dialysis patients who had not been treated with epoetin alfa@@ .).
In animal studies, epoetin alfa has been shown to decrease foetal body weight, delay ossification and increase foetal mortality when given in weekly doses of approximately 20 times the recommended human weekly dose.
These changes are inter@@ pre@@ ted as being secondary to decreased maternal body weight gain.
Epoetin alfa did not show any changes in bacter@@ ial and ma@@ mm@@ al@@ ian cell cul@@ ture mutagenicity te@@ sts and an in vivo micronucleus test in mic@@ e.
Lon@@ g-term carcin@@ ogenicity studies have not been carried ou@@ t.
There are conf@@ lic@@ ting reports in the lit@@ erature reg@@ ar@@ ding whether erythropoietins may pla@@ y a major role as tumour prolifer@@ ator@@ s.
These reports are based on in vitro find@@ ings from human tumour samp@@ les, but are of unc@@ ertain significance in the clinical situ@@ ation.
