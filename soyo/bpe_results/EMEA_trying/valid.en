Tak@@ e special care with Abseame@@ d:
General
In all patients treated with Abseamed blood pressure should be closely monitored and treated, if necessary.
Abseamed should be used with caution in the presence of untreated, inade@@ qu@@ ately treated or po@@ or@@ ly controll@@ able hypertension.
It may be necessary to initi@@ ate or increase treatment against high blood pressu@@ re.
If blood pressure cannot be controlled, Abseamed treatment should be discontinued.
Tak@@ e special care with Abseamed if you have epilepsy or chronic liver disease.
There may be a moderate dose-dependent increase in the platelet count within the normal range during treatment with Abseame@@ d, which gra@@ du@@ ally reg@@ resses during the course of continued therapy.
Y@@ our doctor may do regular blood te@@ sts to ch@@ ec@@ k your blood platelet count during the first 8 weeks of therapy.
All other causes of anaemia, e. g. iron deficiency, da@@ ma@@ ge of red blood cells (@@ haemoly@@ sis@@ ), blood loss, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, should be taken into account and treated prior to initiating therapy with Abseame@@ d.
In order to ensure optim@@ um response to Abseamed adequate iron stores should be en@@ sure@@ d.
Y@@ our doctor may do blood te@@ sts to dec@@ ide@@ , if you need iron supple@@ ment@@ s.
Pure Red Cell Aplasia (PRCA)
Antibody-mediated PRCA has been very rarely reported in patients after months to years of subcutaneous (@@ injection under the skin@@ ) erythropoietin treatment.
PRCA means the in@@ ability to produce en@@ ough red blood cells in the bone marro@@ w@@ .
PRCA can result in sudden and severe anaemia, the symptoms of which are unusual tired@@ ness, feeling dizz@@ y or breath@@ less@@ nes@@ s.
If you experience these symptoms you should tal@@ k to your doctor at onc@@ e.
Y@@ our doctor can dec@@ ide whether Abseamed is not wor@@ king proper@@ ly for you.
If you develo@@ p PRCA your Abseamed therapy will be discontinued and your doctor will dec@@ ide how be@@ st to treat your anaemia.
18@@ 9 K@@ idne@@ y patients
There is not much experience with subcutaneous use (@@ injection into the skin@@ ) of Abseamed in kidney patients.
Therefore, if you are being treated for anaemia associated with kidney disease, Abseamed has to be given by injection into a vein (@@ intraven@@ ous@@ ly@@ ).
Y@@ our doctor will ch@@ ec@@ k your levels of the red blood pig@@ ment (@@ ha@@ e@@ mo@@ glo@@ b@@ in@@ ) regularly
- to ensure that your haemoglobin does not exceed a certain level as high haemoglobin could p@@ u@@ t
you at risk of having a proble@@ m of the heart or the blood ves@@ sel@@ s and could increase risk of death
- to minimise the risk of an increase in blood pressu@@ re.
Increased levels of potassium (hyper@@ k@@ al@@ aemi@@ a) have been observed in isolated cases.
The correction of your anaemia may lead to increased appetite, and th@@ us increased potassium and protein intak@@ e.
There@@ fore dialysis procedu@@ res may have to be adjusted to maintain urea@@ , creatin@@ ine and potassium in the desired range@@ .
Ser@@ um electroly@@ tes should be monitored.
If an elevated or increasing serum potassium level is detec@@ ted, your doctor may con@@ si@@ der to discontinue the treatment with Abseamed until the potassium level has return@@ ed to the normal range@@ .
An increase in dose of a par@@ ti@@ cular bloo@@ d-@@ th@@ inn@@ ing medicine (@@ hep@@ arin@@ ) during haemodialysis is frequently required during the course of therapy with Abseame@@ d.
In@@ adequate th@@ inn@@ ing of the blood by hep@@ ar@@ in (@@ hep@@ arin@@ is@@ ation@@ ) may lead to oc@@ c@@ lu@@ sion of the dialysis system@@ .
If you have chronic kidney failure and clinically ev@@ id@@ ent cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or signs of con@@ ges@@ tion due to in@@ adequate heart out@@ p@@ ut@@ , your doctor will ma@@ k@@ e sure that your haemoglobin levels do not exceed a certain level@@ .
Based on information available to da@@ te, treatment of anaemia with Abseamed in adult patients with chronic kidney failure (@@ renal in@@ suff@@ ic@@ ien@@ cy@@ ) who do not yet require dialy@@ sis, does not accel@@ erate the rate of progression of renal insufficienc@@ y.
Cancer patients
The 2-@@ 3 week delay between epoetin alfa administration and the appe@@ arance of desired effects should be taken into account when assess@@ ing the efficacy of Abseame@@ d.
Y@@ our doctor will ch@@ ec@@ k your levels of the red blood pig@@ ment (@@ ha@@ e@@ mo@@ glo@@ b@@ in@@ ) regularly and adj@@ us@@ t your dose of Abseamed ac@@ cor@@ ding@@ ly to minimise the risk of blood clo@@ tting (@@ thrombotic ev@@ ent@@ s).
Cancer patients receiving treatment with erythropoietin have an increased risk of blood clo@@ ts@@ / blood clo@@ tting disorders (@@ thrombotic vascular ev@@ ent@@ s).
This risk should be carefully weigh@@ ted against the benefit to be derived from treatment with epoetin alfa, particularly if you have an increased risk of thrombotic vascular events, e. g. if you are o@@ be@@ se or have a history of thrombotic vascular events (e. g. deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embol@@ is@@ m).
If you are a cancer patient you should be a@@ w@@ are that Abseamed may act as a blood cell growth factor and in some c@@ ir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ anc@@ es may have a negative impact on your cancer.
D@@ ep@@ en@@ ding on your individual situ@@ ation a blood transfusion may be prefer@@ able@@ .
Please dis@@ cus@@ s this with your doctor.
Patients don@@ ating their o@@ wn blood before surgery
Y@@ our doctor will con@@ si@@ der warnings and precautions associated with autologous blood pre@@ don@@ ation, especially volume replace@@ ment.
Patients scheduled for orthopaedic surgery
If you are due to have major orthopaedic surgery, the cause of anaemia should be established and treated, if possible, before the start of Abseamed treatment.
Blood clo@@ ts (@@ thrombotic ev@@ ent@@ s) can be a
Y@@ our doctor will weight this risk carefully against the benefits to be derived from treatment with epoetin alfa.
You should receive adequate measures in order to pre@@ v@@ ent blood clo@@ ts (@@ thrombotic prophylax@@ is@@ ), particularly if you have cardiovascular disorder@@ s.
If your levels of the red blood pig@@ ment (@@ ha@@ e@@ mo@@ glo@@ b@@ in@@ ) are too high you should not receive Abseame@@ d, since you have an increased risk of blood clo@@ tting after the surgery.
Tum@@ our growth potential
If you are a cancer patient be a@@ w@@ are that erythropoietins may act as growth fac@@ tor@@ .
Please dis@@ cus@@ s this with your doctor.
Taking other medicines
Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have rec@@ ently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.
If you are taking cyclosporin (@@ medicine to su@@ p@@ pres@@ s your immun@@ e system@@ ) during therapy with Abseame@@ d, your doctor may order special blood te@@ sts to me@@ as@@ ure cyclosporin level@@ s.
L@@ ab@@ or@@ atory te@@ sts did not show an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF (@@ G@@ -@@ C@@ S@@ F and GM-CSF are medicines to stimulate the immun@@ e-@@ system e. g. when receiving a chemotherapy for cancer or in case of H@@ I@@ V@@ ).
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
There is not much experience with Abseamed in pregnant women or women who are breast-fe@@ e@@ ding@@ .
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine.
Dri@@ ving and using machines
No effects on ability to drive or use machines have been observed.
