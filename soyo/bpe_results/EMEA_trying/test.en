What is Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ ?
Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a is a solution for infusion (@@ dri@@ p into a v@@ ein@@ ) containing the active substance z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid (@@ 5 mg/ 100 m@@ l).
What is Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a used for@@ ?
Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a is used for the treatment of the following disea@@ ses: • o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis (@@ a disease that ma@@ k@@ es bon@@ es fra@@ gi@@ le@@ ), both in women who have been through the men@@ op@@ au@@ se and in m@@ en.
It is used in patients who are at risk of f@@ rac@@ ture (bone brea@@ k@@ s), including patients who have rec@@ ently brok@@ en their h@@ ip in a min@@ or tra@@ u@@ ma, such as a f@@ all@@ ; • P@@ age@@ t@@ ’ s disease of the bon@@ e, a disease where the normal pro@@ c@@ ess of bone growth is ch@@ an@@ ge@@ d.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a use@@ d?
Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a is given as a 100 ml infusion, la@@ sting at least 15 minu@@ te@@ s.
This can be repeated once a ye@@ ar in patients being treated for o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis.
Patients who have brok@@ en their h@@ ip should receive Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a at least two weeks after the oper@@ ation to re@@ pa@@ ir the f@@ rac@@ tu@@ re.
For P@@ age@@ t@@ ’ s disease, only one infusion of Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a is given.
The effect of the infusion la@@ sts for a ye@@ ar or mo@@ re.
Patients must have adequate flu@@ id@@ s before and after treatment.
A@@ de@@ qu@@ ate supple@@ ments of vitamin D and cal@@ c@@ ium are also recommended for all patients receiving Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ .
In addition, patients with P@@ age@@ t@@ ’ s disease should take at least 500 mg cal@@ c@@ ium t@@ w@@ ice a day for at least 10 days following treatment, and patients who have brok@@ en their h@@ ip should receive a large dose of vitamin D (@@ 5@@ 0,@@ 000 to 12@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000 international un@@ it@@ s) by mouth or by injection into a muscle before their first infusion@@ .
U@@ sing par@@ ac@@ et@@ amo@@ l or ib@@ u@@ pro@@ f@@ en (@@ anti-@@ inflammation medicin@@ es) short@@ ly after Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a can reduce symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, flu@@ -@@ like symptoms, joint pa@@ in and headach@@ e in the three days following the infusion@@ .
Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a is not recommended for use in patients who have severe problems with their kidne@@ ys.
In the treatment of P@@ age@@ t@@ ’ s disease of the bon@@ e, Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a must only be used by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of the disease.
In w@@ om@@ en, o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis is more common after the men@@ op@@ au@@ se, when the levels of the female hormon@@ e o@@ e@@ st@@ ro@@ gen 7 W@@ est@@ fer@@ ry C@@ ir@@ c@@ us, C@@ an@@ ary W@@ har@@ f@@ , Lon@@ d@@ on E@@ 14 4@@ H@@ B, UK Tel@@ .

In P@@ age@@ t@@ ’ s disease the bone brea@@ ks do@@ wn more qu@@ ic@@ k@@ ly, and when it gro@@ w@@ s b@@ ack@@ , it is weak@@ er than normal@@ .
The active substance in Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a, z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid, is a b@@ is@@ phosp@@ h@@ on@@ a@@ te.
It stop@@ s the action of the o@@ ste@@ oc@@ la@@ st@@ s, the cells in the body that are invol@@ ved in brea@@ king do@@ wn the bone tissu@@ e.
This le@@ ad@@ s to less bone loss in o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis and less disease activity in P@@ age@@ t@@ ’ s disease.
How has Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a been studi@@ ed@@ ?
Be@@ cause the active substance in Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a is the same as the active substance in Z@@ om@@ et@@ a, some of the data presen@@ ted for Z@@ om@@ et@@ a were taken into account when assess@@ ing Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ .
For the treatment of o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis, the effects of Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a given once a ye@@ ar have been compared with those of placebo (@@ a d@@ um@@ m@@ y treatment@@ ) in two main studies.
The first invol@@ ved al@@ most 8@@ ,@@ 000 elderly women with o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis, look@@ ing at the number of sp@@ ine and h@@ ip f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res over three years.
The secon@@ d invol@@ ved 2@@ ,@@ 12@@ 7 men and women with o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis who were age@@ d over 50 years and had rec@@ ently brok@@ en their h@@ ip@@ , and look@@ ed at the number of f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res over up to five years.
In both studies, the patients were al@@ lowed to take other medicines for o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis, but not other b@@ is@@ phosp@@ h@@ on@@ ate@@ s.
In P@@ age@@ t@@ ’ s disease, Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a has been studied in a total of 357 patients in two studies, where it was compared with ris@@ e@@ dr@@ on@@ ate (@@ another b@@ is@@ phosp@@ h@@ on@@ ate) over si@@ x month@@ s.
The patients received one infusion of Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a or they received ris@@ e@@ dr@@ on@@ ate once a day for two month@@ s.
The main me@@ as@@ ure of effectiveness was whether blood levels of serum alkal@@ ine phosphatase (@@ an en@@ z@@ y@@ me invol@@ ved in the brea@@ k@@ do@@ wn of bon@@ e) return@@ ed to normal or f@@ el@@ l by at least 7@@ 5% of the wa@@ y b@@ ack to normal level@@ s.
What benefit has Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a shown during the studi@@ es@@ ?
In o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis, Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a was more effective than placebo at reduc@@ ing the number of f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res.
In the study of elderly w@@ om@@ en, the risk of sp@@ ine f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res was reduced by 7@@ 0% in patients taking Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a (@@ without any other medicines for o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis@@ ) over three year@@ s, compared with those taking placebo.
There was a 4@@ 1% risk reduction in h@@ ip f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res, when compar@@ ing all women taking Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a (with or without other o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis medicin@@ es) with those taking placebo.
In the study of men and women who had brok@@ en their h@@ ip@@ , 9% of the patients receiving Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a had a f@@ rac@@ ture (@@ 9@@ 2 out of 1,@@ 06@@ 5@@ ), compared with 13% of the patients receiving placebo (1@@ 39 out of 1,@@ 06@@ 2).
This re@@ presents a 35@@ % reduction in the risk of f@@ rac@@ ture in patients receiving Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ .
In P@@ age@@ t@@ ’ s disease, Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a was more effective than ris@@ e@@ dr@@ on@@ a@@ te.
After si@@ x month@@ s, the proportion of patients who had responded to treatment was 95% in one study and 9@@ 7% in the other@@ , compared with 7@@ 5% and 73% of the patients who received ris@@ e@@ dr@@ on@@ a@@ te.
What is the risk associated with Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ ?
Mo@@ st side effects with Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a ten@@ d to occur within the first three days after infusion, be@@ com@@ ing less common with repeated infusion@@ s.
The most common side effect with Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a (@@ seen in more than 1 patient in 10@@ ) is fe@@ ver@@ .
For the full list of all side effects reported with Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a, see the Package Leafle@@ t.
Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a should not be used in people who may be hyper@@ sensi@@ tive (allerg@@ ic@@ ) to z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid, to other b@@ is@@ phosp@@ h@@ on@@ ates or to any of the other ingredi@@ ents.
Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a should not be used in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemi@@ a (@@ low blood cal@@ c@@ ium level@@ s) or in pregnant or breast-feeding women.
As with all b@@ is@@ phosp@@ h@@ on@@ ates, patients taking Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a may also be at risk of kidney proble@@ ms, reactions at the site of infusion and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis (@@ death of bone tissu@@ e) in the j@@ a@@ w@@ .
W@@ h@@ y has Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a been appro@@ ve@@ d?
The Com@@ mitte@@ e recommended that Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a be given marketing authoris@@ ation.
W@@ h@@ ich measures are being taken to ensure the s@@ af@@ e use of Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ ?
The comp@@ any that ma@@ k@@ es Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a will provide e@@ duc@@ ational pack@@ s for doc@@ tors who presc@@ ri@@ be Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a for o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis, re@@ min@@ ding them how the medicine should be use@@ d, and similar pack@@ s for patients, which expla@@ in the medicin@@ e’ s side effects and when they should contact their doctor.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis • in post@@ -@@ men@@ op@@ au@@ s@@ al women • in men at increased risk of f@@ rac@@ tu@@ re, including those with a recent low@@ -@@ tra@@ um@@ a h@@ ip f@@ rac@@ tu@@ re.
Treatment of P@@ age@@ t@@ ’ s disease of the bon@@ e.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
For the treatment of post@@ -@@ men@@ op@@ au@@ s@@ al o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis and o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis in men, the recommended dose is a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a administered once a year@@ .
In patients with a recent low@@ -@@ tra@@ um@@ a h@@ ip f@@ rac@@ tu@@ re, it is recommended to gi@@ ve the Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a infusion two or more weeks after h@@ ip f@@ rac@@ ture re@@ pa@@ ir (see section 5.1).
For the treatment of P@@ age@@ t@@ ’ s disease, Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a should be prescribed only by physici@@ ans with experience in treatment of P@@ age@@ t@@ ’ s disease of the bon@@ e.
The recommended dose is a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ .
R@@ et@@ reat@@ ment of P@@ age@@ t@@ ’ s disea@@ se: specific re@@ treatment data are not av@@ ail@@ able@@ .
After a single treatment with Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a in P@@ age@@ t@@ ’ s disease, an exten@@ ded remission period is observed in responding patients (see section 5.1).
Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a (@@ 5 mg in 100 ml re@@ ad@@ y-@@ to@@ -@@ inf@@ use solu@@ tion@@ ) is administered via a ven@@ ted infusion line and given at a con@@ st@@ ant infusion rate.
The infusion time must not be less than 15 minu@@ te@@ s.
For information on the infusion of Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a, see section 6.@@ 6.
Patients must be appro@@ pri@@ ately hydra@@ ted prior to administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ .
This is especially important for the elderly and for patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy.
2 A@@ de@@ qu@@ ate cal@@ c@@ ium and vitamin D in@@ take are recommended in association with Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a administr@@ ation.
In addition, in patients with P@@ age@@ t@@ ’ s disease, it is st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly advised that adequate supple@@ mental cal@@ c@@ ium corresponding to at least 500 mg ele@@ mental cal@@ c@@ ium t@@ w@@ ice daily is en@@ su@@ red for at least 10 days following Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a administration (see section 4.4).
In patients with a recent low@@ -@@ tra@@ um@@ a h@@ ip f@@ rac@@ tu@@ re, a lo@@ ad@@ ing dose of 5@@ 0,@@ 000 to 12@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000 IU of vitamin D given orally or via the intramus@@ cular route is recommended prior to the first Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a infusion@@ .
The incidence of post@@ -@@ dose symptoms occur@@ r@@ ing within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a can be reduced with the administration of par@@ ac@@ et@@ amo@@ l or ib@@ u@@ pro@@ f@@ en short@@ ly following Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a administr@@ ation.
Patients with renal impairment (see section 4.4) Use of Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a in patients with creatin@@ ine clearance < 35 m@@ l/ m@@ in is not recommended due to limit@@ ed clinical experience in this popul@@ ation.
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with creatin@@ ine clearance ≥ 35 m@@ l/ min@@ .
Patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2).
El@@ derly patients (≥ 65 year@@ s) No dose adjustment is necessary since bio@@ av@@ ail@@ abil@@ ity, distribution and elimin@@ ation were similar in elderly patients and yo@@ unger subjec@@ ts.
Children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to lack of data on safety and efficac@@ y.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to any b@@ is@@ phosp@@ h@@ on@@ ate@@ s.
Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a is contraindicated for patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemi@@ a (see section 4.4).
Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a is contraindicated during pregnancy and in breast-feeding women (see section 4.@@ 6@@ ).
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
The dose of 5 mg z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid must be administered over at least 15 minu@@ te@@ s.
Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (@@ creatin@@ ine clearance < 35 m@@ l/ min@@ ) due to limit@@ ed clinical experience in this popul@@ ation.
Patients should have their serum creatin@@ ine level measured before receiving Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ .
Patients must be appro@@ pri@@ ately hydra@@ ted prior to administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ .
This is especially important in the elderly and for patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy.
C@@ au@@ tion is indicated when Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a is administered in con@@ j@@ un@@ ction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal fun@@ ction (e. g. amin@@ og@@ ly@@ co@@ si@@ des or di@@ ure@@ tic@@ s that may cause de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation@@ ), see section 4.@@ 5.
Pre@@ -@@ existing hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemi@@ a must be treated by adequate in@@ take of cal@@ c@@ ium and vitamin D before initiating therapy with Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a (see section 4.@@ 3@@ ).
Other di@@ st@@ ur@@ b@@ anc@@ es of min@@ eral metabolism must also be effec@@ tiv@@ el@@ y treated (e. g. di@@ minis@@ hed parathy@@ ro@@ id re@@ ser@@ ve, inte@@ st@@ inal cal@@ c@@ ium mal@@ absorp@@ tion@@ ).
P@@ hy@@ si@@ ci@@ ans should con@@ si@@ der clinical monitoring for these patients.
3 E@@ lev@@ ated bone tur@@ no@@ ver is a ch@@ ar@@ acter@@ is@@ tic of P@@ age@@ t@@ ’ s disease of the bon@@ e.
Due to the rapid on@@ set of effect of z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid on bone tur@@ no@@ ver, transient hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemi@@ a, som@@ eti@@ mes sy@@ mp@@ tom@@ ati@@ c, may develo@@ p and is usually maxim@@ al within the first 10 days after infusion of Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a (see section 4.8).
A@@ de@@ qu@@ ate cal@@ c@@ ium and vitamin D in@@ take are recommended in association with Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a administr@@ ation.
In addition, in patients with P@@ age@@ t@@ 's disease, it is st@@ ron@@ g@@ ly advised that adequate supple@@ mental cal@@ c@@ ium corresponding to at least 500 mg ele@@ mental cal@@ c@@ ium t@@ w@@ ice daily is en@@ su@@ red for at least 10 days following Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a administration (see section 4.@@ 2).
Patients should be in@@ formed about symptoms of hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemi@@ a and receive adequate clinical monitoring during the period of ris@@ k@@ .
Me@@ asure@@ ment of serum cal@@ c@@ ium before infusion of Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a is recommended for patients with P@@ age@@ t@@ ´@@ s disease.
S@@ ever@@ e and oc@@ c@@ a@@ sion@@ ally inc@@ ap@@ ac@@ it@@ ating bon@@ e, joint and/ or muscle pa@@ in have been inf@@ requ@@ ently reported in patients taking b@@ is@@ phosp@@ h@@ on@@ ates, including Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ .
Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a contains the same active substance found in Z@@ om@@ et@@ a (@@ z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid@@ ), used for onc@@ olog@@ y indic@@ ations, and a patient being treated with Z@@ om@@ et@@ a should not be treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ .
O@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the j@@ a@@ w (@@ O@@ N@@ J@@ ):
O@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the j@@ a@@ w has been reported predomin@@ antly in patients with cancer receiving treatment reg@@ im@@ ens including b@@ is@@ phosp@@ h@@ on@@ ates, including z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid@@ .
M@@ any of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ id@@ s.
The ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of reported cases have been associated with d@@ ent@@ al procedu@@ res such as to@@ o@@ th extra@@ c@@ tion.
M@@ any had signs of local infection including o@@ ste@@ om@@ ye@@ li@@ ti@@ s.
A d@@ ent@@ al examin@@ ation with appropriate pre@@ ven@@ tive den@@ ti@@ str@@ y should be considered prior to treatment with b@@ is@@ phosp@@ h@@ on@@ ates in patients with concomitant risk factors (e. g. cancer, chemotherapy, cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ id@@ s, poor oral hy@@ g@@ ien@@ e).
W@@ h@@ ile on treatment, these patients should avo@@ id in@@ v@@ a@@ sive d@@ ent@@ al procedu@@ res if possib@@ le@@ .
For patients who develo@@ p o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the j@@ a@@ w while on b@@ is@@ phosp@@ h@@ on@@ ate therapy, d@@ ent@@ al surgery may ex@@ ac@@ er@@ b@@ ate the con@@ di@@ tion.
For patients requiring d@@ ent@@ al procedu@@ res, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of b@@ is@@ phosp@@ h@@ on@@ ate treatment reduc@@ es the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the j@@ a@@ w@@ .
The clinical ju@@ d@@ ge@@ ment of the treat@@ ing physician should gu@@ ide the management pl@@ an of each patient based on individual benef@@ it@@ / risk assess@@ ment.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Spec@@ if@@ ic dru@@ g@@ -@@ dru@@ g interaction studies have not been conducted with z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid@@ .
Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid is not sy@@ ste@@ mic@@ ally metabolised and does not affect human cy@@ t@@ och@@ ro@@ me P@@ 450 enzymes in vitro (see section 5.2).
Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid is not high@@ ly bound to plasma protein@@ s (approximately 4@@ 3-@@ 5@@ 5% bo@@ und@@ ) and inter@@ actions resulting from di@@ sp@@ lac@@ e@@ ment of high@@ ly prote@@ in-@@ bound dru@@ gs are therefore un@@ li@@ k@@ el@@ y.
Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid is elimin@@ ated by renal exc@@ re@@ tion.
C@@ au@@ tion is indicated when Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a is administered in con@@ j@@ un@@ ction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal fun@@ ction (e. g. amin@@ og@@ ly@@ co@@ si@@ des or di@@ ure@@ tic@@ s that may cause de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation@@ ).
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data on the use of z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid in pregnant women.
Studies in animals with z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid have shown reproductive toxic@@ ological effects including m@@ al@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ ations (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is un@@ kno@@ w@@ n.
It is not known whether z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid is excreted into human breast mil@@ k@@ .
Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a is contraindicated during pregnancy and in breast-feeding women (see section 4.@@ 3@@ ).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performe@@ d.
4 4.8 Undesirable effects
The overall perc@@ ent@@ age of patients who experienced post@@ -@@ dose symptoms were 4@@ 4.@@ 7@@ %, 1@@ 6.@@ 7% and 1@@ 0.@@ 2% after the fir@@ st, secon@@ d and th@@ ir@@ d infusion, respectively.
In@@ c@@ iden@@ ce of individual symptoms following the first infusion was@@ : f@@ ever (1@@ 7@@ .@@ 1@@ %), my@@ al@@ gia (7@@ .@@ 8@@ %), flu@@ -@@ like symptoms (@@ 6.@@ 7@@ %), ar@@ th@@ r@@ al@@ gia (@@ 4.8@@ %) and headach@@ e (@@ 5.1@@ %@@ ).
The incidence of these symptoms decreased mark@@ ed@@ ly with sub@@ sequ@@ ent doses of Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ .
The ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of these symptoms occur within the first three days following Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a administr@@ ation.
The ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of these symptoms were mild to moderate and re@@ sol@@ ved within three days of the ev@@ ent on@@ se@@ t.
The perc@@ ent@@ age of patients who experienced post@@ -@@ dose symptoms was lower in a sm@@ all@@ er study (1@@ 9.@@ 5@@ %, 1@@ 0.@@ 4@@ %, 1@@ 0.@@ 7% after the fir@@ st, secon@@ d and th@@ ir@@ d infusion, respec@@ tiv@@ el@@ y@@ ), where prophylax@@ is against post@@ -@@ dose symptoms was used as described below.
The incidence of post@@ -@@ dose symptoms occur@@ r@@ ing within the first three days after administration of Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a can be reduced with the administration of par@@ ac@@ et@@ amo@@ l or ib@@ u@@ pro@@ f@@ en short@@ ly following Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a administration (see section 4.@@ 2).
In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON – P@@ iv@@ o@@ tal F@@ rac@@ ture T@@ ri@@ al [@@ P@@ F@@ T@@ ] (see section 5.1@@ ), the overall incidence of at@@ ri@@ al f@@ ib@@ r@@ ill@@ ation was 2.@@ 5% (@@ 9@@ 6 out of 3@@ ,@@ 8@@ 6@@ 2) and 1.@@ 9% (7@@ 5 out of 3@@ ,@@ 8@@ 5@@ 2) in patients receiving Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a and placebo, respectively.
The rate of at@@ ri@@ al f@@ ib@@ r@@ ill@@ ation serious adverse events was increased in patients receiving Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a (1.@@ 3@@ %) (@@ 5@@ 1 out of 3@@ ,@@ 8@@ 6@@ 2) compared with patients receiving placebo (@@ 0.@@ 6@@ %) (2@@ 2 out of 3@@ ,@@ 8@@ 5@@ 2).
The me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m be@@ hin@@ d the increased incidence of at@@ ri@@ al f@@ ib@@ r@@ ill@@ ation is un@@ kno@@ w@@ n.
In the o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis trials (P@@ F@@ T@@ , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ r@@ ent F@@ rac@@ ture T@@ ri@@ al [@@ R@@ F@@ T@@ ]@@ ) the po@@ ol@@ ed at@@ ri@@ al f@@ ib@@ r@@ ill@@ ation inc@@ iden@@ c@@ es were comparable between Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a (2@@ .@@ 6@@ %) and placebo (2@@ .@@ 1@@ %@@ ).
For at@@ ri@@ al f@@ ib@@ r@@ ill@@ ation serious adverse events the po@@ ol@@ ed inc@@ iden@@ c@@ es were 1.@@ 3% for Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a and 0.@@ 8@@ % for placebo.
Ver@@ y common (≥ 1/ 10@@ ), common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10@@ ), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100@@ ), rare (≥ 1/ 1@@ 0,@@ 000, < 1/ 1,@@ 000@@ ) adverse dru@@ g reactions are shown in T@@ able 1.

C@@ lass effec@@ ts:
Renal dy@@ sf@@ un@@ ction Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid has been associated with renal dy@@ sf@@ un@@ ction man@@ if@@ es@@ ted as deter@@ i@@ or@@ ation in renal fun@@ ction (i. e. increased serum creatin@@ ine) and in rare cases acute renal failure.
Renal dy@@ sf@@ un@@ ction has been observed following the administration of z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid, especially in patients with pre-@@ existing renal com@@ pro@@ mis@@ e or additional risk factors (e. g onc@@ olog@@ y patients with chemotherapy, concomitant n@@ ep@@ h@@ ro@@ toxic medic@@ ations, severe de@@ hy@@ dr@@ ation@@ ), the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of whom received a 4 mg dose e@@ very 3@@ – 4 weeks, but it has been observed in patients after a single administr@@ ation.
In clinical trials in o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis, the change in creatin@@ ine clearance (@@ measured ann@@ u@@ ally prior to dos@@ ing) and the incidence of renal failure and impairment was comparable for both the Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a and placebo treatment groups over three years.
There was a transient increase in serum creatin@@ ine observed within 10 days in 1.@@ 8@@ % of Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ -treated patients ver@@ su@@ s 0.@@ 8@@ % of placebo-treated patients.
Hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemi@@ a In clinical trials in o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis, approximately 0.@@ 2% of patients had not@@ able de@@ clin@@ es of serum cal@@ c@@ ium levels (@@ less than 1.@@ 8@@ 7 mmol/ l) following Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a administr@@ ation.
No symptomatic cases of hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemi@@ a were observed.
In the P@@ age@@ t@@ ’ s disease trials, symptomatic hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemi@@ a was observed in approximately 1% of patients, in all of whom it re@@ sol@@ ved.
Based on laboratory assess@@ ment, transient as@@ y@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic cal@@ c@@ ium levels below the normal ref@@ eren@@ ce range (@@ less than 2.@@ 10 mmol/ l) occurred in 2.@@ 3% of Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ -treated patients in a large clinical trial compared to 2@@ 1% of Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ -treated patients in the P@@ age@@ t@@ ’ s disease trials.
The frequency of hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemi@@ a was much lower following sub@@ sequ@@ ent infusion@@ s.
All patients received adequate supplementation with vitamin D and cal@@ c@@ ium in the post@@ -@@ men@@ op@@ au@@ s@@ al o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis trial, the prevention of clinical f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res after h@@ ip f@@ rac@@ ture trial, and the P@@ age@@ t@@ ’ s disease trials (see also section 4.@@ 2).
In the trial for the prevention of clinical f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res following a recent h@@ ip f@@ rac@@ tu@@ re, vitamin D levels were not ro@@ ut@@ in@@ ely measured but the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of patients received a lo@@ ad@@ ing dose of vitamin D prior to Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a administration (see section 4.@@ 2).
L@@ oc@@ al reactions In a large clinical trial, local reactions at the infusion sit@@ e, such as red@@ ness, swelling and/ or pain, were reported (@@ 0.@@ 7@@ %) following the administration of z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid@@ .
6 O@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the j@@ a@@ w Un@@ common@@ ly, cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis (@@ primarily of the j@@ a@@ w@@ ) have been rep@@ or@@ ted, predomin@@ antly in cancer patients treated with b@@ is@@ phosp@@ h@@ on@@ ates, including z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid@@ .
M@@ any of these patients had signs of local infection including o@@ ste@@ om@@ ye@@ li@@ tis, and the ma@@ j@@ or@@ ity of the reports ref@@ er to cancer patients following to@@ o@@ th extra@@ c@@ tions or other d@@ ent@@ al surger@@ ie@@ s.
O@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the j@@ a@@ w has multiple well doc@@ um@@ en@@ ted risk factors including a dia@@ gno@@ sis of cancer, concomitant therapie@@ s (e. g. chemotherapy, radio@@ therapy, cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ o@@ id@@ s) and co@@ -@@ mor@@ b@@ id conditions (e. g. anaemia, co@@ ag@@ u@@ lo@@ path@@ ie@@ s, infec@@ tion, pre@@ - existing d@@ ent@@ al disea@@ se@@ ).
Although cau@@ sal@@ ity has not been determin@@ ed, it is pr@@ u@@ d@@ ent to avo@@ id d@@ ent@@ al surgery as recover@@ y may be prolonged (see section 4.4).
In a large clinical trial in 7@@ ,@@ 7@@ 36 patients, o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis of the j@@ a@@ w has been reported in one patient treated with Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a and one patient treated with placebo.
B@@ o@@ th cases re@@ sol@@ ved.
4.9 Overdose
There is no experience of acute intoxic@@ ation with Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ .
Patients who have received doses higher than those recommended should be carefully monitored.
In the ev@@ ent of overdose le@@ ad@@ ing to clinically significant hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemi@@ a, re@@ ver@@ s@@ al may be achieved with supple@@ mental oral cal@@ c@@ ium and/ or an intravenous infusion of cal@@ c@@ ium g@@ lu@@ con@@ a@@ te.

S@@ ing@@ le and multiple 5 and 15@@ -@@ min@@ ute infusion@@ s of 2@@ , 4, 8 and 16 mg z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid in 64 patients y@@ i@@ el@@ ded the following pharmacokinetic dat@@ a, which were found to be dose in@@ depend@@ ent@@ .
After initiation of the z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid infusion, plasma concentrations of the active substance increased ra@@ p@@ i@@ dl@@ y, achie@@ ving their peak at the end of the infusion period, followed by a rapid de@@ clin@@ e to < 10@@ % of peak after 4 hours and < 1% of peak after 24 h@@ ours, with a sub@@ sequ@@ ent prolonged period of very low concentrations not excee@@ ding 0.@@ 1% of peak level@@ s.
Intra@@ ven@@ ously administered z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid is elimin@@ ated by a tr@@ ip@@ ha@@ si@@ c pro@@ c@@ es@@ s: rapid b@@ ip@@ ha@@ si@@ c dis@@ appe@@ arance from the systemic c@@ ir@@ cul@@ ation, with half-@@ li@@ ves of t@@ ½@@ α 0.@@ 24 and t@@ ½@@ β 1.@@ 8@@ 7 h@@ ours, followed by a long elimin@@ ation phase with a ter@@ min@@ al elimin@@ ation half-life of t@@ ½@@ γ 146 hours.
There was no accumul@@ ation of the active substance in plasma after multiple doses given e@@ very 28 da@@ ys.
The early disposition pha@@ ses (@@ α and β@@ , with t@@ ½ values abo@@ ve@@ ) pre@@ su@@ m@@ ably re@@ pres@@ ent rapid up@@ take into bone and exc@@ retion via the kidne@@ ys.
Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid is not metabolised and is excreted unchanged via the kidne@@ y.
O@@ ver the first 24 h@@ ours, 39 ± 1@@ 6% of the administered dose is recovered in the urin@@ e, while the remain@@ der is pr@@ inc@@ ip@@ ally bound to bone tissu@@ e.
F@@ ro@@ m the bone tissue it is re@@ le@@ a@@ sed very slowly b@@ ack into the systemic c@@ ir@@ cul@@ ation and elimin@@ ated via the kidne@@ y.
The total body clearance is 5.@@ 0@@ 4 ± 2@@ .5 l/ h@@ , in@@ dependent of dose, and un@@ affec@@ ted by gender, age, ra@@ ce or body weigh@@ t.
The inter@@ - and in@@ tra@@ -@@ subject vari@@ ation for plasma clearance of z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid was shown to be 3@@ 6% and 3@@ 4@@ %, respectively.
In@@ c@@ reasing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minu@@ tes cau@@ sed a 3@@ 0% decrease in z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid concentration at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the are@@ a under the plasma concentration ver@@ su@@ s time cur@@ v@@ e.
No specific dru@@ g@@ -@@ dru@@ g interaction studies have been conducted with z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid@@ .
S@@ ince z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid is not metabolised in humans and the substance was found to have lit@@ t@@ le or no cap@@ ac@@ ity as a direc@@ t@@ - ac@@ ting and/ or ir@@ re@@ ver@@ sible metabolis@@ m@@ -@@ dependent inhibitor of P@@ 450 en@@ z@@ y@@ me@@ s, z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid is unlikely to reduce the metabolic clearance of subst@@ anc@@ es which are metabolised via the cy@@ t@@ och@@ ro@@ me P@@ 450 en@@ z@@ y@@ me system@@ s.
Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid is not high@@ ly bound to plasma protein@@ s (approximately 4@@ 3-@@ 5@@ 5% bo@@ und@@ ) and binding is concentration in@@ depend@@ ent@@ .
Therefore, inter@@ actions resulting from di@@ sp@@ lac@@ e@@ ment of high@@ ly prote@@ in-@@ bound dru@@ gs are un@@ li@@ k@@ el@@ y.
Special popul@@ ations (see section 4.@@ 2) The renal clearance of z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid was cor@@ related with creatin@@ ine cle@@ ar@@ ance, renal clearance re@@ presenting 75 ± 3@@ 3% of the creatin@@ ine cle@@ ar@@ ance, which showed a mean of 84 ± 29 m@@ l/ m@@ in (@@ range 22 to 14@@ 3 m@@ l/ min@@ ) in the 64 patients studi@@ ed.
S@@ mal@@ l observed increases in A@@ U@@ C@@ (@@ 0@@ -@@ 2@@ 4@@ hr@@ ), by about 3@@ 0% to 40% in mild to moderate renal impairment@@ , compared to a patient with normal renal f@@ unc@@ tion, and lack of accumul@@ ation of dru@@ g with multiple doses ir@@ respec@@ tive of renal f@@ unc@@ tion, suggest that dose adjustments of z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid in mild (C@@ l@@ c@@ r = 50@@ – 80 m@@ l/ min@@ ) and moderate renal impairment do@@ wn to a creatin@@ ine clearance of 35 m@@ l/ m@@ in are not necessary.
As only limit@@ ed data are available in severe renal impairment (@@ creatin@@ ine clearance < 30 m@@ l/ min@@ ), no dosing recommend@@ ations are possible for this popul@@ ation.
11 5.3 Preclinical safety data
Ac@@ ute toxicity The highest non-@@ le@@ th@@ al single intravenous dose was 10 mg/ kg body weight in mi@@ ce and 0.@@ 6 mg/ kg in ra@@ ts.
In the single-@@ dose do@@ g infusion studies, 1.@@ 0 mg/ kg (@@ 6 fol@@ d the recommended human therapeutic exposure based on AUC) administered over 15 minu@@ tes was well tol@@ erated with no renal effec@@ ts.
Su@@ b@@ chronic and chronic toxicity In the intravenous infusion studies, renal toler@@ ability of z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid was established in rats when given 0.@@ 6 mg/ kg as 15@@ -@@ min@@ ute infusion@@ s at 3-@@ day interv@@ al@@ s, si@@ x times in total (for a c@@ umul@@ ative dose that cor@@ responded to AUC levels about 6 times the human therapeutic exposu@@ re) while five 15@@ -@@ min@@ ute infusion@@ s of 0.@@ 25 mg/ kg administered at 2@@ – 3-@@ week intervals (@@ a c@@ umul@@ ative dose that cor@@ responded to 7 times the human therapeutic exposu@@ re) were well tol@@ erated in do@@ g@@ s.
In the intravenous bol@@ us studies, the doses that were w@@ el@@ l@@ -@@ tol@@ erated decreased with increasing study dur@@ ation:
0.@@ 2 and 0.@@ 0@@ 2 mg/ kg daily was well tol@@ erated for 4 weeks in rats and do@@ g@@ s, respec@@ tiv@@ el@@ y but only 0.@@ 01 mg/ kg and 0.@@ 00@@ 5 mg/ kg in rats and do@@ g@@ s, respectively, when given for 52 weeks.
Lon@@ ger@@ -@@ term repe@@ at administration at c@@ umul@@ ative exposures suff@@ ici@@ ently excee@@ ding the maximum inten@@ ded human exposure produced toxic@@ ological effects in other organ@@ s, including the ga@@ st@@ ro@@ inte@@ st@@ inal tra@@ c@@ t and li@@ ver, and at the site of intravenous administr@@ ation.
The clinical relev@@ ance of these find@@ ings is un@@ kno@@ w@@ n.
The most frequent fin@@ ding in the repe@@ at-@@ dose studies consis@@ ted of increased primary spon@@ gi@@ os@@ a in the me@@ t@@ ap@@ hy@@ ses of long bon@@ es in gro@@ wing animals at ne@@ arly all do@@ ses, a fin@@ ding that ref@@ le@@ c@@ ted the com@@ po@@ und@@ ’ s pharmacological anti@@ re@@ sor@@ p@@ tive activ@@ ity.
Re@@ production toxicity T@@ erat@@ olog@@ y studies were performed in two spec@@ ie@@ s, both via subcutaneous administr@@ ation.
T@@ erat@@ ogenicity was observed in rats at doses ≥ 0.@@ 2 mg/ kg and was man@@ if@@ es@@ ted by ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al, vis@@ c@@ eral and skele@@ tal m@@ al@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ ations.
Dy@@ st@@ oc@@ ia was observed at the lowest dose (@@ 0.@@ 01 mg/ kg body weigh@@ t@@ ) te@@ s@@ ted in ra@@ ts.
No ter@@ at@@ ological or emb@@ r@@ yo@@ / foetal effects were observed in ra@@ bb@@ it@@ s, although maternal toxicity was mark@@ ed at 0.@@ 1 mg/ kg due to decreased serum cal@@ c@@ ium level@@ s.
M@@ uta@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity and carcinogenic potential Z@@ ole@@ dr@@ on@@ ic acid was not mu@@ ta@@ gen@@ ic in the mutagenicity te@@ sts performed and carcin@@ ogenicity te@@ sting did not provide any evidence of carcinogenic potenti@@ al.

WHAT AC@@ LA@@ S@@ T@@ A IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a is given as a single infusion into a vein by a doctor or n@@ ur@@ se.
It be@@ lon@@ gs to a group of medicines called b@@ is@@ phosp@@ h@@ on@@ ates and is used to treat o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis in post@@ -@@ men@@ op@@ au@@ s@@ al w@@ om@@ en, o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis in men and P@@ age@@ t@@ ’ s disease of the bon@@ e.
O@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis O@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis is a disease that invol@@ ves the th@@ inn@@ ing and weak@@ en@@ ing of the bon@@ es and is common in women after the men@@ op@@ au@@ se, but can also occur in m@@ en.
At the men@@ op@@ au@@ se, a w@@ om@@ an@@ ’ s o@@ var@@ ies sto@@ p produc@@ ing the female hormon@@ e o@@ e@@ st@@ ro@@ g@@ en, which hel@@ p@@ s k@@ eep bon@@ es health@@ y.
Following the men@@ op@@ au@@ se bone loss occurs, bon@@ es become weak@@ er and brea@@ k more e@@ a@@ si@@ ly.
M@@ any patients with o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis have no symptoms but they are sti@@ l@@ l at risk of brea@@ king bon@@ es because o@@ ste@@ op@@ or@@ o@@ sis has made their bon@@ es weak@@ er.
D@@ ec@@ reased c@@ ir@@ cul@@ ating levels of se@@ x hormon@@ es, main@@ ly o@@ e@@ st@@ ro@@ gen@@ s con@@ ver@@ ted from and@@ ro@@ gen@@ s, also pla@@ y a role in the more gra@@ du@@ al bone loss observed in m@@ en.
In both women and men, Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a st@@ ren@@ g@@ th@@ ens the bone and therefore ma@@ k@@ es it less li@@ k@@ ely to brea@@ k@@ .
Be@@ cause Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a wor@@ ks for a long ti@@ me, you will not need another dose of Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a for a year@@ .
P@@ age@@ t@@ ’ s disease of the bone It is normal that ol@@ d bone is remo@@ ved and is replac@@ ed with new bone mat@@ er@@ i@@ al.
This pro@@ c@@ ess is called re@@ mo@@ del@@ lin@@ g.
In P@@ age@@ t@@ ’ s disease, bone re@@ mode@@ ll@@ ing is too rapid and new bone is formed in a disorder@@ ed f@@ as@@ h@@ i@@ on, which ma@@ k@@ es it weak@@ er than normal@@ .
If the disease is not treated, bon@@ es may become de@@ formed and pa@@ inf@@ ul@@ , and may brea@@ k@@ .
Ac@@ la@@ st@@ a wor@@ ks by return@@ ing the bone re@@ mode@@ ll@@ ing pro@@ c@@ ess to normal@@ , sec@@ ur@@ ing formation of normal bon@@ e, th@@ us re@@ st@@ or@@ ing st@@ ren@@ g@@ th to the bon@@ e.

• Depres@@ sive disorders
or Depres@@ sive disorders or mo@@ od alter@@ ations with depres@@ sive symptoms have been reported in up to 10@@ %, and suicidal ide@@ ation in up to 1@@ %, of patients receiving ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant (see section 4.8).
In patients with current suicidal ide@@ ations and/ or with a history of suicidal ide@@ ation and depres@@ sive disorder ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant
ut@@ h should not be used unless the benefits of treatment are considered to out@@ weig@@ h these risks in an individual patient@@ .
(See section 4.3 and 4.8).
O@@ be@@ sity is a condition that can be associated with depres@@ sive disorder@@ s.
Depres@@ sive disorders can be associated with an increased risk of suicidal though@@ ts, sel@@ f har@@ m and suici@@ de.
r@@ a The presc@@ ri@@ ber should carefully investig@@ ate if the patient has had a depres@@ sive disorder in the p@@ ast in order to evalu@@ ate the potential risks with ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant treatment.
ge Depres@@ sive reactions may occur in patients who have no ob@@ vi@@ ous risk fac@@ tors, ap@@ ar@@ t from obesity it@@ sel@@ f@@ .
In post@@ marketing experienc@@ e, more than half of the patients who develo@@ p such reactions appe@@ ar to do so within 1 month of starting treatment, approximately 8@@ 0% appe@@ ar to do so within 3 month@@ s. l@@ on Patients should be ac@@ tiv@@ el@@ y monitored for signs and symptoms of p@@ sy@@ ch@@ i@@ at@@ ri@@ c disorder@@ s, particularly depres@@ sion following the start of treatment.
The patient should be monitored and treated appro@@ pri@@ ate@@ ly.
P@@ ati@@ ent@@ s, especially those with a history of depres@@ sive disorder@@ s@@ / mo@@ od alter@@ ations, (@@ and rel@@ ati@@ ves or no

Con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors will lead to increased exposure of ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant.
Con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of CYP3A4 induc@@ ers is expected to reduce the exposure of ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant. c@@ t
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ an@@ t:
Con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of ketoconaz@@ ole (@@ a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor@@ ) increased ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant AUC d@@ u
by 10@@ 4% (95% pre@@ dic@@ tion interv@@ al@@ :
40% - 1@@ 9@@ 7@@ %@@ ).
A similar increase in exposure is expected with other potent CYP3A4 inhibitor@@ s.
C@@ au@@ tion is advised during concomitant use of AC@@ O@@ MP@@ LI@@ A and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e. g. ketoconaz@@ ol@@ e, it@@ ra@@ conaz@@ ol@@ e, rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir@@ , te@@ li@@ thro@@ my@@ c@@ in, c@@ lar@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ c@@ in, ne@@ fa@@ z@@ o@@ don@@ e). r@@ o
Although concomitant administration of CYP3A4 induc@@ ers (e. g. ri@@ fa@@ mp@@ icin, phen@@ ytoin, phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ it@@ al, carbamazep@@ ine, S@@ t J@@ oh@@ n@@ ’ s w@@ ort@@ ) has not been studi@@ ed, it is expected that concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 induc@@ ers may reduce the plasma concentration of ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and may result in loss of l@@ p
efficac@@ y.
Con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of or@@ lis@@ t@@ at, eth@@ an@@ ol or lor@@ azep@@ am had no significant effect on the plasma in@@ a
levels of ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant.
Potential for ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant to affect other medicinal produc@@ ts:
The in vivo inhibitor@@ y effect on CYP2@@ C@@ 8 has not been studi@@ ed.
However, in vit@@ ro@@ , ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant had a dic
mild inhibitor@@ y effect on CYP2@@ C@@ 8.
The potential for in@@ hib@@ i@@ tion of CYP2@@ C@@ 8 in vivo appe@@ ar@@ s to be low.
R@@ im@@ on@@ ab@@ ant does not in@@ hibit or induce other C@@ Y@@ P enzymes or P@@ -@@ glyco@@ protein (P@@ -@@ g@@ p@@ ) in vitro.

The potential risk for humans is un@@ kno@@ w@@ n.
Use in pregnancy is, there@@ fore, not recommended.
Patients should no@@ tif@@ y
ise their physician if they become pregnant during treatment with AC@@ O@@ MP@@ LI@@ A.
R@@ im@@ on@@ ab@@ ant has been detected in the mil@@ k of lact@@ ating rats and ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may in@@ hibit the su@@ ck@@ l@@ ing ref@@ lex@@ .
It is not known if ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant is excreted in human mil@@ k@@ .
AC@@ O@@ MP@@ LI@@ A is contraindicated during

4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ut@@ h No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performe@@ d.
C@@ o@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ tive investig@@ ations in clinical pharmac@@ olog@@ y studies demonstrated that ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant is de@@ vo@@ id of any significant co@@ g@@ n@@ i@@ tive or sed@@ ative effec@@ t.
r@@ a 4.8 Undesirable effects
AC@@ O@@ MP@@ LI@@ A 20 mg has been evaluated for safety in approximately 25@@ 00 patients en@@ r@@ ol@@ led in studies
ge that examin@@ ed the metabolic and weight loss effects in over@@ weight and o@@ be@@ se patients and in approximately 38@@ 00 patients in other indic@@ ations.
In placebo-controlled studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 15.@@ 7% for patients receiving ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant.
The most common adverse l@@ on reactions resulting in discontinuation w@@ er@@ e: nausea, mo@@ od alter@@ ation with depres@@ sive symptoms, depres@@ sive disorder@@ s, anxiety and dizzin@@ es@@ s.
Depres@@ sive disorders were reported in 3.@@ 2% of o@@ be@@ se patients, or over@@ weight patients with associated risk fac@@ tor@@ (@@ s) treated with ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg.
These were usually mild or moderate in sever@@ ity and no
resul@@ ted in recover@@ y in all cases either after correc@@ tive treatment or discontinuation of ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and did not ex@@ hibit any differenti@@ ating characteristics compared to cases reported in the control group@@ s.

AC@@ O@@ MP@@ LI@@ A 20 mg was effective in maintaining weight loss up to two years.
Weight loss at two years

ise -@@ 0.3 under placebo (@@ Differen@@ ce -@@ 0.@@ 5@@ 1 CI@@ 95% -@@ 0.@@ 78@@ , -@@ 0.@@ 24 p < 0.@@ 00@@ 1@@ ).
The perc@@ ent@@ age of patients rea@@ ching H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c < 7% was 5@@ 1% in the ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35@@ % in the placebo group.
The difference in mean body weight change between the 20 mg and placebo groups was 3.@@ 8 kg (@@ CI@@ 95% -@@ 5.@@ 0@@ , -@@ 2.@@ 6 p < 0.@@ 00@@ 1@@ ).
Chan@@ ges in H@@ D@@ L@@ -@@ C and T@@ G in this population were similar to that of the non-@@ diabetic popul@@ ation.
It is
or estimated that approximately half of the mean improvement in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c in patients receiving ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg was beyond that expected from weight loss alone.
ut@@ h 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
R@@ im@@ on@@ ab@@ ant pharmacokinetics are fa@@ ir@@ ly dose propor@@ tional up to about 20 mg.
AUC increased less than in proportion to dose above 20 mg.
r@@ a Ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion:
R@@ im@@ on@@ ab@@ ant di@@ sp@@ la@@ ys high in vitro per@@ me@@ ability and is not a subst@@ rate of P@@ -@@ glyco@@ protein@@ .
The absolute bioavailability of ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant has not been determin@@ ed.
Following multiple onc@@ e-@@ daily doses of 20 mg
ge to healthy subjects in the f@@ as@@ ted state, maximum plasma concentrations of ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant are achieved in approximately 2 hours with ste@@ ady state plasma levels achieved within 13 days (@@ Cmax = 1@@ 9@@ 6 ± 2@@ 8.@@ 1 ng/ m@@ l@@ ; C@@ t@@ rou@@ g@@ h = 9@@ 1.@@ 6 ± 1@@ 4.1 ng/ m@@ l@@ ; A@@ U@@ C@@ 0@@ -@@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 26@@ 8 n@@ g. h@@ / m@@ l).
S@@ te@@ ady state ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant l@@ on exposures are 3.@@ 3-@@ fol@@ d higher than those observed after the first dose.
Pop@@ ulation pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated less flu@@ c@@ tu@@ ation in peak to t@@ rou@@ g@@ h plasma concentration but no differences in ste@@ ady state AUC as weight increa@@ ses.
As weight increases from 65 to 200 kg, Cmax is expected to decrease 2@@ 4% and C@@ t@@ rou@@ g@@ h is expected to increase by 5@@ %.
Pop@@ ulation no
pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant pharmacokinetics are similar between healthy non-@@ smo@@ king subjects and patients who smok@@ e.
Adminis@@ tr@@ ation of ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant to healthy subjects in the f@@ as@@ ted state or with a high f@@ at me@@ al demonstrated that Cmax and AUC were increased 6@@ 7% and 4@@ 8@@ % respectively, under f@@ ed condition@@ s.
In clinical studies, AC@@ O@@ MP@@ LI@@ A 20 mg was taken in the mor@@ n@@ ing usually before brea@@ k@@ fa@@ st. d@@ u
Dis@@ tribu@@ tion:
The in vitro human plasma protein binding of ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant is high (> 99@@ .@@ 9@@ %) and non-@@ sat@@ u@@ ra@@ ble over a r@@ o
w@@ ide concentration range@@ .
The apparent peripheral volume of distribution of ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant appe@@ ar@@ s to be related to body weight, with o@@ be@@ se patients having a higher volume of distribution than normal@@ -@@ weight subjec@@ ts. l@@ p
Bio@@ trans@@ form@@ ation:
R@@ im@@ on@@ ab@@ ant is metabol@@ iz@@ ed by both C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A and a@@ mi@@ do@@ hy@@ dr@@ ol@@ ase (@@ predomin@@ antly hep@@ ati@@ c@@ ) path@@ ways in in@@ a
C@@ ir@@ cul@@ ating metabolites do not con@@ trib@@ ute to its pharmac@@ olog@@ ic activ@@ ity.
Elimination:
O@@ n@@ ly dic
an appro@@ x@@ im@@ ate 3% of the dose of ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant is elimin@@ ated in the urin@@ e, while approximately 8@@ 6% of the dose is excreted in the fa@@ ec@@ es as unchanged dru@@ g and metabolit@@ es.
M@@ e
9 Special Pop@@ ul@@ ations Rac@@ e:
In sing@@ le@@ - and repe@@ at-@@ dose studies, the Cmax and AUC of ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant were similar in healthy J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese
d and C@@ au@@ ca@@ si@@ an subjects, wh@@ er@@ e@@ as elimin@@ ation half-life was shor@@ ter in J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese subjects (@@ 3-@@ 4 da@@ y@@ s) compared to C@@ au@@ ca@@ si@@ an subjects (@@ about 9 da@@ y@@ s).
The difference in half-life was due to differences in
ise peripheral volume of distribution as a con@@ sequ@@ ence of lower weight in J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese subjec@@ ts.
B@@ lack patients may have up to a 3@@ 1% lower Cmax and a 4@@ 3% lower AUC than patients of other rac@@ es.
Gender:
or The pharmacokinetics of ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant are similar in female and male patients.
Elderly:
ut@@ h El@@ derly patients have s@@ ligh@@ tly higher exposure than yo@@ ung patients.
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis (@@ age range 18 - 81 year@@ s) a 75 ye@@ ar ol@@ d patient is estimated to have a 2@@ 1% higher Cmax and a 27% higher AUC than a 40 ye@@ ar ol@@ d patient@@ .
r@@ a Patients with hepatic in@@ suff@@ ic@@ ien@@ cy@@ :
Mil@@ d hepatic impairment does not al@@ ter ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant exposu@@ re.
Dat@@ a are insufficient to dra@@ w conc@@ lu@@ sions reg@@ ar@@ ding pharmacokinetics in moderate hepatic impairment.
Patients with severe hepatic impairment were not evalu@@ ated.
ge Patients with renal impairment:
The effect of renal fun@@ ction on the pharmacokinetics of ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant has not been studied specif@@ ic@@ al@@ ly. l@@ on Based on data from population pharmacokinetic studies, mild renal impairment do not se@@ e@@ m to affect the pharmacokinetics of ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant.
L@@ i@@ mit@@ ed data suggest an increased exposure in patients with moderate renal impairment (@@ 40% increase in A@@ U@@ C@@ ).
There are no data in severe renal impairment.
Ad@@ ver@@ se reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with possible relev@@ ance to clinical use were as fol@@ low@@ s:
Con@@ v@@ ul@@ sions were observed spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally in studies in ro@@ d@@ ents and m@@ ac@@ a@@ qu@@ es.
No convul@@ sions were c@@ t
observed in do@@ gs during a 3 month study.
In som@@ e, but not all cases, initiation of convul@@ sions appeared to be associated with procedu@@ ral st@@ re@@ ss such as handling of the an@@ im@@ als.
A pro@@ convul@@ s@@ ant activity of ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was found in one of two safety pharmac@@ olog@@ y studies.
No adverse effect of ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant d@@ u

In standard fer@@ tility studies in female rats (@@ dosing for 2 weeks prior to mat@@ ing) there was abnormal in@@ a
o@@ est@@ rou@@ s cy@@ c@@ lic@@ ity and a decrease in cor@@ por@@ a lu@@ te@@ a and fer@@ tility inde@@ x at doses of ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant that induced maternal toxicity (30 and 60 mg/ kg/ da@@ y).
Following dosing for a lon@@ ger treatment dur@@ ation prior to mat@@ ing (@@ 9 weeks) that per@@ mit@@ ted recover@@ y from the initial effects of ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant, no adverse effects were seen on fer@@ tility or o@@ est@@ rou@@ s cy@@ c@@ lic@@ ity.
Re@@ g@@ ar@@ ding reproductive para@@ me@@ ter@@ s, at 30 mg/ kg no dic
differences were observed between treated animals and control@@ s, at 60 mg/ kg effects were sti@@ l@@ l observed (@@ decreased number of cor@@ por@@ a lu@@ te@@ a, imp@@ l@@ an@@ t@@ ations, total and vi@@ able f@@ et@@ use@@ s).

were observed in the ra@@ bb@@ it emb@@ r@@ yo@@ f@@ et@@ al toxicity studies at doses resulting in exposures comparable with the clinical exposu@@ res.
Although maternal toxicity was observed at these do@@ ses, a rel@@ ation to treatment cannot be excluded.
No treatment@@ -@@ related m@@ al@@ f@@ or@@ m@@ ations were seen in the ra@@ t.
10 Effects of ri@@ m@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ -@@ nat@@ al development were assessed in the ra@@ t at doses up to 10 mg/ kg/ day.
There was a treatment related increase in p@@ up mortality in the pre-@@ we@@ an@@ ing period.
The increased p@@ up mortality might be at@@ trib@@ ut@@ able to a failure of the da@@ m to n@@ ur@@ se or in@@ ges@@ tion of

What is Ac@@ to@@ s@@ ?
Ac@@ to@@ s is a medicine containing the active substance p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ on@@ e.
The wh@@ it@@ e, ro@@ und tablets contain 15@@ , 30 or 45 mg of p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ on@@ e.
What is Ac@@ to@@ s used for@@ ?
Ac@@ to@@ s is used to treat type 2 diabetes (@@ also known as n@@ on in@@ su@@ lin@@ -@@ dependent diabete@@ s). • It can be used on its o@@ wn (@@ mono@@ ther@@ ap@@ y) in patients (@@ particularly those who are over@@ weigh@@ t@@ ) who cannot use me@@ t@@ form@@ in (@@ an anti@@ diabetic medicin@@ e). • It can be used to@@ ge@@ ther with one other anti@@ diabetic medicine (@@ du@@ al ther@@ ap@@ y).
It can be ad@@ ded to me@@ t@@ form@@ in in patients (@@ particularly those who are over@@ weigh@@ t@@ ) who are not sati@@ sfac@@ tor@@ ily controlled on me@@ t@@ form@@ in used on its o@@ wn and at the maximum tol@@ erated dose.
Alternatively, it can be ad@@ ded to a sul@@ p@@ h@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a (@@ another anti@@ diabetic medicin@@ e) in patients for whom me@@ t@@ form@@ in is not suitable and who are not sati@@ sfac@@ tor@@ ily controlled with the sul@@ p@@ h@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a used on its o@@ wn at the maximum tol@@ erated dose. • It can be used to@@ ge@@ ther with two other anti@@ diabetic medicines, me@@ t@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ p@@ h@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ rea@@ , as tr@@ ip@@ le therapy in patients (@@ particularly those who are over@@ weigh@@ t@@ ) who are not sati@@ sfac@@ tor@@ ily controlled with these two medicin@@ es. • It can be used to@@ ge@@ ther with in@@ sul@@ in in patients who are not sati@@ sfac@@ tor@@ ily controlled with in@@ sul@@ in alone and cannot take me@@ t@@ for@@ min@@ .
How is Ac@@ to@@ s use@@ d?
Ac@@ to@@ s is taken once daily with or without fo@@ od.
The dose is adjusted to gi@@ ve the be@@ st control.
The recommended starting dose is 15 mg or 30 mg once da@@ il@@ y.
This dose may need to be increased after one or two weeks to up to 45 mg once da@@ il@@ y.
In combination with me@@ t@@ for@@ min@@ , the current me@@ t@@ form@@ in dose can be continued when starting Ac@@ to@@ s treatment.
In combination with a sul@@ p@@ h@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a or in@@ su@@ lin@@ , the current sul@@ p@@ h@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a or in@@ sul@@ in dose can be continued when starting Ac@@ to@@ s treatment unless the patient has hypo@@ glycaemia (@@ low blood gluco@@ se@@ ), when the dose of the sul@@ p@@ h@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a or in@@ sul@@ in should be decrea@@ sed.

How has Ac@@ to@@ s been studi@@ ed@@ ?
Ac@@ to@@ s has been studied in clinical pharmac@@ olog@@ y studies and in clinical trials.
Al@@ most 7@@ ,@@ 000 patients received Ac@@ to@@ s in all trials com@@ bin@@ ed.
The studies compared Ac@@ to@@ s to placebo (@@ a d@@ um@@ m@@ y treatment@@ ), or to other anti@@ diabetic medicines (@@ me@@ t@@ for@@ min@@ , g@@ lic@@ la@@ z@@ ide@@ ).
Some studies also look@@ ed at com@@ bin@@ ing Ac@@ to@@ s with other anti@@ diabetic medicines (@@ sul@@ p@@ h@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ reas@@ , in@@ su@@ lin@@ , me@@ t@@ for@@ min@@ ).
Further studies also look@@ ed at lon@@ g-term use of Ac@@ to@@ s.
In tr@@ ip@@ le therapy, the effectiveness of Ac@@ to@@ s was studied in more than 1,@@ 400 patients who were receiving a combination of me@@ t@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ p@@ h@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ rea@@ , to which was ad@@ ded either Ac@@ to@@ s or placebo for up to 3@@ .5 years.
The studies measured the level in the blood of a substance (@@ glycosylated ha@@ e@@ mo@@ glo@@ b@@ in@@ , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ ), which gi@@ ves an indication of how well the blood glucose is controlle@@ d.
What benefit has Ac@@ to@@ s shown during the studi@@ es@@ ?
Ac@@ to@@ s led to a decrease in the level of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c, indicating that blood glucose levels had been reduced at doses of 15 mg@@ , 30 mg and 45 mg.
D@@ o@@ ses below 15 mg were not effec@@ tiv@@ e, and doses above 45 mg (@@ once daily) did not show additional benef@@ it@@ .
Ac@@ to@@ s on its o@@ wn was shown to be as effective as me@@ t@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ z@@ ide@@ .
In com@@ bin@@ ation, Ac@@ to@@ s showed that it im@@ pro@@ ves the control obtained in type 2 diabetes when ad@@ ded to existing treatment.
At the end of the tr@@ ip@@ le therapy stu@@ d@@ y, the effect of ad@@ ding Ac@@ to@@ s to the existing treatment with me@@ t@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ p@@ h@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a was a 0.@@ 9@@ 4% reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c level@@ s, while ad@@ ding placebo led to a 0.@@ 35@@ % reduc@@ tion.
In a s@@ mal@@ l study examin@@ ing the combination of Ac@@ to@@ s and in@@ sul@@ in in 28@@ 9 patients, patients ad@@ ding Ac@@ to@@ s to in@@ sul@@ in had a 0.@@ 69% reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels after 6 month@@ s, compared to 0.@@ 14@@ % in those ad@@ ding placebo.
What is the risk associated with Ac@@ to@@ s@@ ?
The most common side effects with Ac@@ to@@ s are vis@@ u@@ al di@@ st@@ ur@@ b@@ ance, upper re@@ spira@@ tory tra@@ c@@ t infection (@@ col@@ d@@ s), weight increa@@ se, and hypo@@ a@@ es@@ th@@ esi@@ a (@@ decreased sensitivity to a stimul@@ us@@ ).
For the full list of all side effects reported with Ac@@ to@@ s, see the Package Leafle@@ t.
Ac@@ to@@ s should not be used in people who may be hyper@@ sensi@@ tive (allerg@@ ic@@ ) to p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one or any of the other ingredi@@ ent@@ s, or in patients with liver proble@@ ms, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (@@ high levels of keton@@ es [@@ acid@@ s@@ ] in the bloo@@ d).
W@@ h@@ y has Ac@@ to@@ s been appro@@ ve@@ d?
The com@@ mitte@@ e recommended that Ac@@ to@@ s be given marketing authoris@@ ation.
In monotherapy (@@ used on its o@@ wn@@ ), the com@@ mitte@@ e dec@@ ided that Ac@@ to@@ s should be an altern@@ ative to the standard treatment, me@@ t@@ for@@ min@@ , to be used when patients cannot take me@@ t@@ for@@ min@@ .

Patients with renal impairment:
No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impa@@ i@@ red renal fun@@ ction (@@ creatin@@ ine clearance > 4 m@@ l/ min@@ ) (see section 5.2).
No information is available from dialy@@ sed patients therefore p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one should not be used in such patients.

Children and adolesc@@ ents:
There are no data available on the use of p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one in patients under 18 years of age, and therefore its use is not recommended in this age group.
4.3 Contraindications
P@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one is contraindicated in patients with@@ :
- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients
- cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure (@@ N@@ Y@@ H@@ A stage@@ s I to IV@@ )
- hepatic impairment
- diabetic ketoac@@ ido@@ sis.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Flu@@ id re@@ tention and cardiac fail@@ ure@@ :
P@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one can cause flu@@ id re@@ ten@@ tion, which may ex@@ ac@@ er@@ b@@ ate or precip@@ it@@ ate heart failure.
When treat@@ ing patients who have at least one risk factor for development of con@@ ge@@ sti@@ ve heart failure (e. g. prior myocardial infarction or symptomatic cor@@ on@@ ary arter@@ y disea@@ se@@ ), physici@@ ans should start with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gra@@ du@@ al@@ ly.
Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema particularly those with reduced cardiac re@@ ser@@ v@@ e.
There have been cases of cardiac failure reported from the mark@@ et when p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one was used in combination with in@@ su@@ lin@@ or in patients with a history of cardiac fail@@ ure@@ ; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one is used in combination with in@@ su@@ lin@@ .
S@@ ince in@@ sul@@ in and p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one are associated with flu@@ id re@@ ten@@ tion, concomitant administration may increase the risk of o@@ ede@@ ma@@ .
P@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one should be discontinued if any deter@@ i@@ or@@ ation in cardiac status occurs.
A cardiovascular out@@ come study of p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one has been performed in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-@@ existing major m@@ ac@@ ro@@ vascular disease.
P@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one or placebo was ad@@ ded to existing anti@@ diabetic and cardiovascular therapy for up to 3@@ .5 years.
This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure, ho@@ we@@ ver this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study.
C@@ au@@ tion should be ex@@ er@@ c@@ ised in patients over 75 years because of the limit@@ ed experience in this patient group.
3 M@@ on@@ it@@ or@@ ing of liver f@@ unc@@ tion:
There have been rare reports of hep@@ at@@ oc@@ el@@ l@@ ular dy@@ sf@@ un@@ ction during post-marketing experience (see section 4.8).
It is recommen@@ de@@ d, there@@ fore, that patients treated with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one under@@ go per@@ i@@ odi@@ c monitoring of liver enzymes.
L@@ i@@ ver enzymes should be ch@@ ec@@ k@@ ed prior to the initiation of therapy with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one in all patients.
Therap@@ y with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one should not be initi@@ ated in patients with increased baseline liver en@@ z@@ y@@ me levels (@@ A@@ L@@ T > 2@@ .5 X upper limit of normal@@ ) or with any other evidence of liver disease.
Following initiation of therapy with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ on@@ e, it is recommended that liver enzymes be monitored periodically based on clinical ju@@ d@@ ge@@ ment.
If ALT levels are increased to 3 X upper limit of normal during p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one therapy, liver en@@ z@@ y@@ me levels should be reas@@ se@@ s@@ sed as soon as possib@@ le@@ .
If ALT levels remain > 3 X the upper limit of normal@@ , therapy should be discontinued.
If any patient develop@@ s symptoms sugge@@ sting hepatic dy@@ sf@@ unc@@ tion, which may include unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigu@@ e, an@@ ore@@ xi@@ a and/ or dar@@ k urin@@ e, liver enzymes should be ch@@ ec@@ ke@@ d.
The dec@@ is@@ ion whether to continue the patient on therapy with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one should be gu@@ ided by clinical ju@@ d@@ ge@@ ment pen@@ ding laboratory evalu@@ ations.
If j@@ a@@ un@@ di@@ ce is obser@@ ve@@ d, dru@@ g therapy should be discontinued.
Weight gain:
In clinical trials with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one there was evidence of dose related weight gain, which may be due to f@@ at accumul@@ ation and in some cases associated with flu@@ id re@@ ten@@ tion.
In some cases weight increase may be a sy@@ mp@@ to@@ m of cardiac failure, therefore weight should be closely monitored.
P@@ ar@@ t of the treatment of diabetes is di@@ et@@ ary control.
Patients should be advised to ad@@ h@@ er@@ e str@@ ic@@ tly to a cal@@ or@@ ie@@ -controlled di@@ et.
Hae@@ matolog@@ y:
There was a s@@ mal@@ l reduction in mean haemoglobin (@@ 4% relative reduc@@ tion@@ ) and haematocrit (@@ 4.@@ 1% relative reduc@@ tion@@ ) during therapy with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ on@@ e, consis@@ tent with haemo@@ di@@ lu@@ tion.
Si@@ mi@@ la@@ r changes were seen in me@@ t@@ form@@ in (haemoglobin 3 - 4% and haematocrit 3.@@ 6 – 4.@@ 1% relative reduc@@ tion@@ s) and to a less@@ er extent sul@@ p@@ h@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a and in@@ sul@@ in (haemoglobin 1 – 2% and haematocrit 1 – 3.@@ 2% relative reduc@@ tion@@ s) treated patients in compar@@ ative controlled trials with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ on@@ e.
Hypo@@ glycaemia
As a con@@ sequ@@ ence of increased in@@ sul@@ in sensitiv@@ ity, patients receiving p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one in du@@ al or tr@@ ip@@ le oral therapy with a sul@@ p@@ h@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a or in du@@ al therapy with in@@ sul@@ in may be at risk for dose-@@ related hypo@@ glyc@@ aemi@@ a, and a reduction in the dose of the sul@@ p@@ h@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a or in@@ sul@@ in may be necessary.
Eye disorders:
Po@@ st-@@ marketing reports of ne@@ w@@ -@@ on@@ set or worsening diabetic m@@ ac@@ ular oedema with decreased vis@@ u@@ al ac@@ u@@ ity have been reported with th@@ ia@@ z@@ ol@@ id@@ ine@@ di@@ on@@ es, including p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ on@@ e.
M@@ any of these patients reported conc@@ ur@@ r@@ ent peripheral o@@ ede@@ ma@@ .
It is uncle@@ ar whether or not there is a direc@@ t association between p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one and m@@ ac@@ ular oedema but presc@@ ri@@ b@@ er@@ s should be al@@ er@@ t to the possibility of m@@ ac@@ ular oedema if patients rep@@ or@@ t di@@ st@@ ur@@ b@@ anc@@ es in vis@@ u@@ al ac@@ u@@ it@@ y; an appropriate op@@ h@@ th@@ al@@ m@@ ological re@@ fer@@ ral should be considered.
O@@ ther@@ s:
An increased incidence in bone f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res in women was seen in a po@@ ol@@ ed analysis of adverse ev@@ ent reports of bone f@@ rac@@ ture from randomised, controlled, dou@@ ble b@@ lin@@ d clinical trials in over 8@@ 100 p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one and 7@@ 400 compar@@ at@@ or treated patients, on treatment for up to 3@@ .5 years.
F@@ rac@@ tu@@ res were observed in 2.@@ 6% of women taking p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one compared to 1.@@ 7% of women treated with a compar@@ ator@@ .
No increase in f@@ rac@@ ture rates was observed in men treated with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one (1.@@ 3@@ %) ver@@ su@@ s compar@@ at@@ or (1.@@ 5@@ %@@ ).
4 The f@@ rac@@ ture incidence cal@@ cul@@ ated was 1.@@ 9 f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res per 100 patient years in women treated with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one and 1.@@ 1 f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res per 100 patient years in women treated with a compar@@ ator@@ .
The observed excess risk of f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res for women in this dat@@ a@@ set on p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one is therefore 0.@@ 8 f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res per 100 patient years of use.
In the 3@@ .5 ye@@ ar cardiovascular risk PR@@ O@@ active stu@@ d@@ y, 4@@ 4@@ / 8@@ 70 (@@ 5.1@@ %@@ ; 1.@@ 0 f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res per 100 patient year@@ s) of p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ on@@ e-treated female patients experienced f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res compared to 2@@ 3@@ / 9@@ 05 (2@@ .@@ 5@@ %@@ ; 0.5 f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res per 100 patient year@@ s) of female patients treated with compar@@ ator@@ .
No increase in f@@ rac@@ ture rates was observed in men treated with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one (1.@@ 7@@ %) ver@@ su@@ s compar@@ at@@ or (2@@ .@@ 1@@ %@@ ).
The risk of f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res should be considered in the long term care of women treated with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ on@@ e.
As a con@@ sequ@@ ence of enhan@@ c@@ ing in@@ sul@@ in ac@@ tion, p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one treatment in patients with poly@@ cy@@ sti@@ c o@@ vari@@ an syn@@ dro@@ me may result in re@@ su@@ mp@@ tion of o@@ v@@ ul@@ ation.
These patients may be at risk of pregn@@ anc@@ y.
Patients should be a@@ w@@ are of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient w@@ is@@ h@@ es to become pregnant or if pregnancy occurs, the treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.@@ 6@@ ).
P@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one should be used with caution during concomitant administration of cy@@ t@@ och@@ ro@@ me P@@ 450 2C@@ 8 inhibitors (e. g. ge@@ m@@ f@@ ib@@ ro@@ z@@ il@@ ) or induc@@ ers (e. g. ri@@ fa@@ mp@@ ic@@ in@@ ).
Glyc@@ aemi@@ c control should be monitored clo@@ se@@ ly.
P@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one dose adjustment within the recommended po@@ sol@@ og@@ y or changes in diabetic treatment should be considered (see section 4.5).
Ac@@ to@@ s tablets contain lactose mono@@ hydrate and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary problems of g@@ alac@@ tose intoler@@ ance, the L@@ ap@@ p lac@@ ta@@ se deficienc@@ y or gluco@@ se-@@ g@@ alac@@ tose mal@@ absorp@@ tion.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have shown that p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmac@@ o@@ dyn@@ a@@ mic@@ s of dig@@ o@@ x@@ in, war@@ f@@ ar@@ in, phen@@ pro@@ c@@ ou@@ mon and me@@ t@@ for@@ min@@ .
C@@ o@@ -@@ administration of p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one with sul@@ p@@ h@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ as does not appe@@ ar to affect the pharmacokinetics of the sul@@ p@@ h@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ rea@@ .
Studies in ma@@ n suggest no induc@@ tion of the main induc@@ ib@@ le cy@@ t@@ och@@ ro@@ me P@@ 4@@ 50@@ , 1@@ A, 2C@@ 8@@ / 9 and 3A@@ 4.
In vitro studies have shown no in@@ hib@@ i@@ tion of any sub@@ type of cy@@ t@@ och@@ ro@@ me P@@ 4@@ 50@@ .
Inter@@ actions with subst@@ anc@@ es metabolised by these en@@ z@@ y@@ me@@ s, e. g. oral contra@@ c@@ ep@@ tiv@@ es, cyclo@@ spor@@ in, cal@@ c@@ ium ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l block@@ ers, and H@@ M@@ G@@ C@@ o@@ A reduc@@ ta@@ se inhibitors are not to be expec@@ ted.
C@@ o@@ -@@ administration of p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one with ge@@ m@@ f@@ ib@@ ro@@ z@@ il (@@ an inhibitor of cy@@ t@@ och@@ ro@@ me P@@ 450 2C@@ 8@@ ) is reported to result in a 3-@@ fol@@ d increase in AUC of p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ on@@ e.
S@@ ince there is a potential for an increase in dose-@@ related adverse events, a decrease in the dose of p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one may be ne@@ e@@ ded when ge@@ m@@ f@@ ib@@ ro@@ z@@ il is concomitantly adminis@@ ter@@ ed.
C@@ lose monitoring of glyc@@ aemi@@ c control should be considered (see section 4.4).
C@@ o@@ - administration of p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one with ri@@ fa@@ mp@@ ic@@ in (@@ an inducer of cy@@ t@@ och@@ ro@@ me P@@ 450 2C@@ 8@@ ) is reported to result in a 5@@ 4% decrease in AUC of p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ on@@ e.
The p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one dose may need to be increased when ri@@ fa@@ mp@@ ic@@ in is concomitantly adminis@@ ter@@ ed.
C@@ lose monitoring of glyc@@ aemi@@ c control should be considered (see section 4.4).
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Use in pregn@@ anc@@ y:
F@@ o@@ et@@ al growth re@@ st@@ r@@ ic@@ tion was apparent in animal studies with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ on@@ e.
This was at@@ trib@@ ut@@ able to the action of p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one in di@@ minis@@ h@@ ing the maternal hyper@@ in@@ su@@ lin@@ aemi@@ a and increased in@@ sul@@ in re@@ sis@@ t@@ ance that occurs during pregnancy ther@@ eb@@ y reduc@@ ing the av@@ ail@@ ability of metabolic subst@@ rates for foetal gro@@ w@@ th@@ .
The relev@@ ance of such a me@@ ch@@ an@@ is@@ m in humans is uncle@@ ar and p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one should not be used in pregn@@ anc@@ y.
5 Use in breast-fe@@ e@@ ding@@ :
P@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one has been shown to be pres@@ ent in the mil@@ k of lact@@ ating ra@@ ts.
It is not known whether p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one is sec@@ reted in human mil@@ k@@ .
Therefore, p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one should not be administered to breast-feeding women.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No effects on ability to drive and use machines have been observed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Ad@@ ver@@ se reactions reported in excess (> 0.@@ 5@@ %) of placebo and as more than an isolated case in patients receiving p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one in double-blin@@ d studies are listed below as Me@@ d@@ D@@ R@@ A prefer@@ red term by system or@@ g@@ an cl@@ ass and absolute f@@ requ@@ enc@@ y.

Eye disorders M@@ ac@@ ular o@@ ede@@ ma@@ : not known
8 O@@ ede@@ ma was reported in 6 – 9% of patients treated with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one over one ye@@ ar in controlled clinical trials.
The oedema rates for compar@@ at@@ or groups (@@ sul@@ p@@ h@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ rea@@ , me@@ t@@ for@@ min@@ ) were 2 – 5@@ %.
The reports of oedema were generally mild to moderate and usually did not require discontinuation of treatment.
In active compar@@ at@@ or controlled trials mean weight increase with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one given as monotherapy was 2 – 3 kg over one year@@ .
This is similar to that seen in a sul@@ p@@ h@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a active compar@@ at@@ or group.
In combination trials p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one ad@@ ded to me@@ t@@ form@@ in resul@@ ted in mean weight increase over one ye@@ ar of 1@@ .5 kg and ad@@ ded to a sul@@ p@@ h@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a of 2.@@ 8 k@@ g.

V@@ is@@ u@@ al di@@ st@@ ur@@ b@@ ance has been reported main@@ ly early in treatment and is related to changes in blood glucose due to temp@@ or@@ ary alter@@ ation in the tur@@ gi@@ di@@ ty and ref@@ rac@@ tive inde@@ x of the l@@ ens as seen with other hypo@@ glyc@@ aemi@@ c agents.
In clinical trials with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one the incidence of e@@ lev@@ ations of ALT greater than three times the upper limit of normal was equ@@ al to placebo but less than that seen in me@@ t@@ form@@ in or sul@@ p@@ h@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a compar@@ at@@ or group@@ s.
Me@@ an levels of liver enzymes decreased with treatment with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ on@@ e.
R@@ are cases of elevated liver enzymes and hep@@ at@@ oc@@ el@@ l@@ ular dy@@ sf@@ un@@ ction have occurred in post-marketing experienc@@ e.
Although in very rare cases fatal out@@ come has been rep@@ or@@ ted, cau@@ s@@ al rel@@ ation@@ sh@@ ip has not been established.
In controlled clinical trials the incidence of reports of heart failure with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one treatment was the same as in placebo, me@@ t@@ form@@ in and sul@@ p@@ h@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a treatment group@@ s, but was increased when used in combination therapy with in@@ su@@ lin@@ .
In an out@@ come study of patients with pre-@@ existing major m@@ ac@@ ro@@ vascular disease, the incidence of serious heart failure was 1.@@ 6% higher with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one than with placebo, when ad@@ ded to therapy that included in@@ su@@ lin@@ .
However, this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study.
H@@ e@@ ar@@ t failure has been reported rarely with marketing use of p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ on@@ e, but more frequently when p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one was used in combination with in@@ sul@@ in or in patients with a history of cardiac failure.
A po@@ ol@@ ed analysis was conducted of adverse ev@@ ent reports of bone f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res from randomised, compar@@ at@@ or controlled, dou@@ ble b@@ lin@@ d clinical trials in over 8@@ 100 patients in the p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ on@@ e-treated groups and 7@@ 400 in the compar@@ ator@@ -treated groups of up to 3@@ .5 years dur@@ ation.
A higher rate of f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res was observed in women taking p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one (2@@ .@@ 6@@ %) ver@@ su@@ s compar@@ at@@ or (1.@@ 7@@ %@@ ).
No increase in f@@ rac@@ ture rates was observed in men treated with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one (1.@@ 3@@ %) ver@@ su@@ s compar@@ at@@ or (1.@@ 5@@ %@@ ).
In the 3@@ .5 ye@@ ar PR@@ O@@ active stu@@ d@@ y, 4@@ 4@@ / 8@@ 70 (@@ 5.1@@ %) of p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ on@@ e-treated female patients experienced f@@ rac@@ tu@@ res compared to 2@@ 3@@ / 9@@ 05 (2@@ .@@ 5@@ %) of female patients treated with compar@@ ator@@ .
No increase in f@@ rac@@ ture rates was observed in men treated with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one (1.@@ 7@@ %) ver@@ su@@ s compar@@ at@@ or (2@@ .@@ 1@@ %@@ ).
4.9 Overdose

Treatment with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one has been shown to reduce hepatic glucose out@@ p@@ u@@ t and to increase peripheral glucose disposal in the case of in@@ sul@@ in re@@ sis@@ tanc@@ e.
Fa@@ sting and post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al glyc@@ aemi@@ c control is im@@ pro@@ ved in patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ it@@ us.
The im@@ pro@@ ved glyc@@ aemi@@ c control is associated with a reduction in both fa@@ sting and post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al plasma in@@ sul@@ in concentrations.
A clinical trial of p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one v@@ s. g@@ lic@@ la@@ z@@ ide as monotherapy was exten@@ ded to two years in order to asse@@ ss time to treatment failure (@@ defined as appe@@ arance of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0% after the first si@@ x months of ther@@ ap@@ y).
K@@ ap@@ l@@ an@@ -@@ M@@ ei@@ er analysis showed shor@@ ter time to treatment failure in patients treated with g@@ lic@@ la@@ z@@ ide@@ , compared with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ on@@ e.
At two year@@ s, glyc@@ aemi@@ c control (@@ defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c < 8.@@ 0@@ %) was sustained in 69% of patients treated with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ on@@ e, compared with 5@@ 0% of patients on g@@ lic@@ la@@ z@@ ide@@ .
In a t@@ w@@ o@@ -@@ ye@@ ar study of combination therapy compar@@ ing p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one with g@@ lic@@ la@@ z@@ ide when ad@@ ded to me@@ t@@ for@@ min@@ , glyc@@ aemi@@ c control measured as mean change from baseline in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was similar between treatment groups after one year@@ .
The rate of deter@@ i@@ or@@ ation of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c during the secon@@ d ye@@ ar was less with p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one than with g@@ lic@@ la@@ z@@ ide@@ .
In a placebo controlled trial, patients with in@@ adequate glyc@@ aemi@@ c control de@@ sp@@ it@@ e a three month in@@ sul@@ in op@@ ti@@ mis@@ ation period were random@@ ised to p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one or placebo for 12 month@@ s.
Patients receiving p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one had a mean reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c of 0.@@ 4@@ 5% compared with those continu@@ ing on in@@ sul@@ in alon@@ e, and a reduction of in@@ sul@@ in dose in the p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one treated group.

T@@ w@@ o@@ -@@ ye@@ ar clinical studies have shown maintenance of this effec@@ t.
In one ye@@ ar clinical trials, p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one consis@@ t@@ ently ga@@ ve a statistically significant reduction in the album@@ in@@ / creatin@@ ine ratio compared to ba@@ se@@ lin@@ e.
The effect of p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one (@@ 45 mg monotherapy v@@ s. placebo@@ ) was studied in a s@@ mal@@ l 18@@ -@@ week trial in type 2 dia@@ be@@ tic@@ s.
P@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one was associated with significant weight gain.
V@@ is@@ c@@ eral f@@ at was significantly decrea@@ sed, while there was an increase in extra@@ -@@ abdominal f@@ at m@@ as@@ s.
Si@@ mi@@ la@@ r changes in body f@@ at distribution on p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one have been accomp@@ anied by an improvement in in@@ sul@@ in sensitiv@@ ity.
In most clinical trials, reduced total plasma tr@@ ig@@ ly@@ c@@ er@@ i@@ des and f@@ ree f@@ at@@ ty acid@@ s, and increased H@@ D@@ L@@ -@@ ch@@ ol@@ est@@ er@@ ol levels were observed as compared to placebo, with sm@@ all, but not clinically significant increases in L@@ D@@ L@@ -@@ ch@@ ol@@ est@@ er@@ ol level@@ s.
In clinical trials of up to two years dur@@ ation, p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one reduced total plasma tr@@ ig@@ ly@@ c@@ er@@ i@@ des and f@@ ree f@@ at@@ ty acid@@ s, and increased H@@ D@@ L ch@@ ol@@ est@@ er@@ ol level@@ s, compared with placebo, me@@ t@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ z@@ ide@@ .
P@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one did not cause statistically significant increases in L@@ D@@ L ch@@ ol@@ est@@ er@@ ol levels compared with placebo, wh@@ il@@ st reductions were observed with me@@ t@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ z@@ ide@@ .
In a 20@@ -@@ week stu@@ d@@ y, as well as reduc@@ ing fa@@ sting tr@@ ig@@ ly@@ c@@ er@@ ide@@ s, p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one reduced po@@ st p@@ ran@@ di@@ al hyper@@ tr@@ ig@@ ly@@ c@@ er@@ id@@ aemi@@ a through an effect on both absor@@ bed and hep@@ ati@@ c@@ ally syn@@ th@@ es@@ ised tr@@ ig@@ ly@@ c@@ er@@ ide@@ s.
These effects were in@@ dependent of p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ on@@ e@@ ’ s effects on glycaemia and were statistically significant different to g@@ li@@ ben@@ c@@ la@@ mi@@ de.
In PR@@ O@@ activ@@ e, a cardiovascular out@@ come stu@@ d@@ y, 5@@ 2@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-@@ existing major m@@ ac@@ ro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ised to p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one or placebo in addition to existing anti@@ diabetic and cardiovascular therapy, for up to 3@@ .5 years.
The study population had an a@@ ver@@ age age of 62 years; the a@@ ver@@ age dur@@ ation of diabetes was 9.5 years.
Appro@@ xi@@ ma@@ tely one th@@ ir@@ d of patients were receiving in@@ sul@@ in in combination with me@@ t@@ form@@ in and/ or a sul@@ p@@ h@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ rea@@ .

Al@@ most half of the patients had a previous myocardial infarction and approximately 2@@ 0% had had a strok@@ e.
Appro@@ xi@@ ma@@ tely half of the study population had at least two of the cardiovascular history entr@@ y c@@ rit@@ er@@ ia.
Al@@ most all subjects (@@ 9@@ 5@@ %) were receiving cardiovascular medic@@ ations (@@ bet@@ a block@@ ers, AC@@ E inhibitor@@ s, an@@ gi@@ o@@ ten@@ s@@ in I@@ I antagonis@@ ts, cal@@ c@@ ium ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l block@@ ers, n@@ it@@ ra@@ tes, di@@ ure@@ tic@@ s, as@@ p@@ ir@@ in, stat@@ in@@ s, f@@ ib@@ ra@@ te@@ s).
10 Although the study failed reg@@ ar@@ ding its primary end@@ po@@ in@@ t, which was a com@@ po@@ s@@ it@@ e of all@@ -@@ cause mortal@@ ity, n@@ on@@ - fatal myocardial infarc@@ tion, stroke, acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ me, major le@@ g amp@@ ut@@ ation, cor@@ on@@ ary re@@ v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and le@@ g re@@ v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ is@@ ation, the results suggest that there are no lon@@ g-term cardiovascular concern@@ s reg@@ ar@@ ding use of p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ on@@ e.
However, the inc@@ iden@@ c@@ es of oedema, weight gain and heart failure were increa@@ sed.
No increase in mortality from heart failure was observed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion:
Following oral administr@@ ation, p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one is rapid@@ ly absor@@ be@@ d, and peak plasma concentrations of unchanged p@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one are usually achieved 2 hours after administr@@ ation.
P@@ rop@@ or@@ tional increases of the plasma concentration were observed for doses from 2 – 60 mg.
S@@ te@@ ady state is achieved after 4@@ – 7 days of dos@@ ing.
R@@ ep@@ e@@ ated dosing does not result in accumul@@ ation of the com@@ po@@ und or metabolit@@ es.
Ab@@ sor@@ p@@ tion is not influ@@ enc@@ ed by food intak@@ e.
Ab@@ sol@@ ute bioavailability is greater than 80@@ %.
Dis@@ tribu@@ tion:
The estimated volume of distribution in humans is 0.@@ 25 l/ k@@ g.
P@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one and all active metabolites are exten@@ sively bound to plasma protein (> 99@@ %@@ ).
Metabolis@@ m@@ :
P@@ i@@ og@@ l@@ ita@@ z@@ one undergo@@ es extensive hepatic metabolism by hydrox@@ ylation of al@@ iph@@ atic meth@@ yl@@ ene group@@ s.
This is predomin@@ antly via cy@@ t@@ och@@ ro@@ me P@@ 450 2C@@ 8 although other iso@@ forms may be invol@@ ved to a less@@ er de@@ gre@@ e.
