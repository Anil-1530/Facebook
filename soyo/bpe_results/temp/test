What is A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a@@ ?
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is a solution for infusion (@@ drip into a ve@@ in@@ ) containing the active substance zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid (@@ 5 mg/ 100 ml).
What is A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a used for?
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is used for the treatment of the following disease@@ s: • o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ rosis (a disease that makes bon@@ es f@@ rag@@ il@@ e), both in women who have been through the men@@ o@@ pa@@ use and in m@@ en.
It is used in patients who are at risk of f@@ r@@ act@@ ure (bone bre@@ ak@@ s), including patients who have recently bro@@ k@@ en their hi@@ p in a minor tra@@ uma@@ , such as a fall@@ ; • P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease of the bon@@ e, a disease where the normal pro@@ c@@ ess of bone growth is chang@@ ed.
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription.
How is A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a used?
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is given as a 100 ml infusion, lasting at least 15 minut@@ es.
This can be repeated once a year in patients being treated for o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ ro@@ sis.
Patients who have bro@@ k@@ en their hi@@ p should receive A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a at least two weeks after the oper@@ ation to re@@ pa@@ ir the f@@ r@@ act@@ ure.
For P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease, only one infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is given.
The effect of the infusion l@@ ast@@ s for a year or mo@@ re.
Patients must have adequate flu@@ id@@ s before and after treatment.
A@@ de@@ qu@@ ate suppl@@ ements of vitamin D and calcium are also recommended for all patients receiving A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a.
In addition, patients with P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease should take at least 500 mg calcium t@@ w@@ ice a day for at least 10 days following treatment, and patients who have bro@@ k@@ en their hi@@ p should receive a large dose of vitamin D (@@ 5@@ 0,@@ 000 to 12@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000 international un@@ it@@ s) by mouth or by injection into a muscle before their first infusion.
Using par@@ ace@@ ta@@ mo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ prof@@ en (@@ anti-@@ inflammation medicin@@ es) short@@ ly after A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce symptoms such as fever, muscle pain, flu@@ -@@ like symptoms, joint pain and headache in the three days following the infusion.
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in patients who have severe problems with their kidne@@ ys.
In the treatment of P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease of the bon@@ e, A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must only be used by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of the disease.

In P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease the bone bre@@ ak@@ s down more quick@@ ly, and when it g@@ row@@ s b@@ ack@@ , it is weak@@ er than normal@@ .
The active substance in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a, zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid, is a b@@ is@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate.
It stop@@ s the action of the o@@ ste@@ oc@@ l@@ ast@@ s, the cells in the body that are involved in bre@@ ak@@ ing down the bone tissu@@ e.
This le@@ ad@@ s to less bone loss in o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ rosis and less disease activity in P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease.
How has A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a been studied?
Because the active substance in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as the active substance in Z@@ om@@ e@@ ta@@ , some of the data presented for Z@@ omet@@ a were taken into account when assessing A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a.
For the treatment of o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ ro@@ sis, the effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a given once a year have been compared with those of placebo (a du@@ mm@@ y treatment@@ ) in two main studies.
The first involved al@@ most 8@@ ,@@ 000 elderly women with o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ ro@@ sis, looking at the number of sp@@ ine and hi@@ p f@@ r@@ act@@ ures over three years.
The second involved 2@@ ,@@ 127 men and women with o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ rosis who were aged over 50 years and had recently bro@@ k@@ en their h@@ ip@@ , and looked at the number of f@@ r@@ act@@ ures over up to five years.
In both studies, the patients were allowed to take other medicines for o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ ro@@ sis, but not other b@@ is@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ es.
In P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease, A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a has been studied in a total of 357 patients in two studies, where it was compared with ri@@ sed@@ ron@@ ate (another b@@ is@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ e) over six month@@ s.
The patients received one infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a or they received ri@@ sed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for two month@@ s.
The main measure of effectiveness was whether blood levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (@@ an enzym@@ e involved in the bre@@ ak@@ down of bon@@ e) retur@@ n@@ ed to normal or f@@ ell by at least 7@@ 5% of the way back to normal level@@ s.
What benefit has A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a shown during the studies?
In o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ ro@@ sis, A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was more effective than placebo at reducing the number of f@@ r@@ act@@ ures.
In the study of elderly wom@@ en, the risk of sp@@ ine f@@ r@@ act@@ ures was reduced by 7@@ 0% in patients taking A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a (@@ without any other medicines for o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ ro@@ si@@ s) over three year@@ s, compared with those taking placebo.
There was a 41% risk reduction in hi@@ p f@@ r@@ act@@ ures, when comparing all women taking A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a (with or without other o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ rosis medicin@@ es) with those taking placebo.
In the study of men and women who had bro@@ k@@ en their h@@ ip@@ , 9% of the patients receiving A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a f@@ r@@ act@@ ure (@@ 92 out of 1,@@ 0@@ 6@@ 5@@ ), compared with 13% of the patients receiving placebo (@@ 139 out of 1,@@ 0@@ 6@@ 2).
This represents a 35@@ % reduction in the risk of f@@ r@@ act@@ ure in patients receiving A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a.
In P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease, A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was more effective than ri@@ sed@@ ron@@ ate.
After six month@@ s, the proportion of patients who had responded to treatment was 95% in one study and 9@@ 7% in the other@@ , compared with 7@@ 5% and 73% of the patients who received ri@@ sed@@ ron@@ ate.
What is the risk associated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a@@ ?
M@@ os@@ t side effects with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ten@@ d to occur within the first three days after infusion, bec@@ om@@ ing less common with repeated infusions.
The most common side effect with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) is fe@@ ver.
For the full list of all side effects reported with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a, see the Package Leaflet.
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid, to other b@@ is@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or to any of the other ingredients.
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should not be used in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemia (low blood calcium level@@ s) or in pregnant or breast-feeding women.
As with all b@@ is@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates, patients taking A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a may also be at risk of kidney problems, reactions at the site of infusion and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rosis (@@ death of bone tissu@@ e) in the j@@ a@@ w.
Why has A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a been approved?
The Committee recommended that A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a be given marketing authorisation.
Wh@@ ich measures are being taken to ensure the saf@@ e use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a@@ ?
The company that makes A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a will provide educational pack@@ s for doct@@ ors who prescribe A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ ro@@ sis, re@@ min@@ ding them how the medicine should be use@@ d, and similar pack@@ s for patients, which explain the medicin@@ e’ s side effects and when they should contact their doctor.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment of o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ rosis • in post@@ -@@ men@@ o@@ pa@@ us@@ al women • in men at increased risk of f@@ r@@ act@@ ure, including those with a recent low-@@ tra@@ um@@ a hi@@ p f@@ r@@ act@@ ure.
Treatment of P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease of the bon@@ e.
4.2 Posology and method of administration
For the treatment of post@@ -@@ men@@ o@@ pa@@ us@@ al o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ rosis and o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ rosis in m@@ en, the recommended dose is a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a administered once a year@@ .
In patients with a recent low-@@ tra@@ um@@ a hi@@ p f@@ r@@ act@@ ure, it is recommended to g@@ ive the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a infusion two or more weeks after hi@@ p f@@ r@@ act@@ ure re@@ pa@@ ir (see section 5.1).
For the treatment of P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease, A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should be prescribed only by physicians with experience in treatment of P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease of the bon@@ e.
The recommended dose is a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a.
Re@@ treatment of P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease@@ : specific re@@ treatment data are not avail@@ able.
After a single treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease, an extended remission period is observed in responding patients (see section 5.1).
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a (@@ 5 mg in 100 ml read@@ y-@@ to@@ -@@ inf@@ use solu@@ tion@@ ) is administered via a vented infusion line and given at a con@@ stant infusion rate.
The infusion time must not be less than 15 minut@@ es.
For information on the infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a, see section 6.6.
Patients must be appropriately hyd@@ rated prior to administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a.
This is especially important for the elderly and for patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy.
2 A@@ de@@ qu@@ ate calcium and vitamin D in@@ take are recommended in association with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a administration.
In addition, in patients with P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease, it is stron@@ g@@ ly advised that adequate supplement@@ al calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium t@@ w@@ ice daily is ensured for at least 10 days following A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a administration (see section 4.4).
In patients with a recent low-@@ tra@@ um@@ a hi@@ p f@@ r@@ act@@ ure, a lo@@ ad@@ ing dose of 5@@ 0,@@ 000 to 12@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000 IU of vitamin D given orally or via the intramuscular route is recommended prior to the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a infusion.
The incidence of post@@ -@@ dose symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced with the administration of par@@ ace@@ ta@@ mo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ prof@@ en short@@ ly following A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a administration.
Patients with renal impairment (see section 4.4) Use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in patients with creatinine clearance < 35 ml/ m@@ in is not recommended due to limited clinical experience in this population.
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with creatinine clearance ≥ 35 ml/ min@@ .
Patients with hepatic impairment No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2).
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) No dose adjustment is necessary since bioavail@@ abil@@ ity, distribution and elimination were similar in elderly patients and younger subjects.
Children and adolescents A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents below 18 years of age due to lack of data on safety and eff@@ icac@@ y.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients or to any b@@ is@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ es.
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is contraindicated for patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemia (see section 4.4).
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is contraindicated during pregnancy and in breast-feeding women (see section 4.@@ 6@@ ).
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
The dose of 5 mg zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid must be administered over at least 15 minut@@ es.
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (@@ creatinine clearance < 35 ml/ min@@ ) due to limited clinical experience in this population.
Patients should have their serum creatinine level measured before receiving A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a.
Patients must be appropriately hyd@@ rated prior to administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a.
This is especially important in the elderly and for patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy.
C@@ a@@ ution is indicated when A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is administered in con@@ j@@ un@@ ction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function (e. g. amin@@ og@@ ly@@ co@@ si@@ d@@ es or di@@ ure@@ tic@@ s that may cause de@@ hyd@@ r@@ ation@@ ), see section 4.@@ 5.
Pre@@ -@@ existing hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemia must be treated by adequate in@@ take of calcium and vitamin D before initiating therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a (see section 4.@@ 3@@ ).
Other disturb@@ ances of min@@ eral metabolism must also be effec@@ tiv@@ ely treated (e. g. di@@ mini@@ shed parath@@ yroid re@@ ser@@ v@@ e, intestinal calcium mal@@ absor@@ p@@ tion@@ ).
P@@ hy@@ si@@ ci@@ ans should consi@@ der clinical monitoring for these patients.
3 E@@ lev@@ ated bone tur@@ no@@ ver is a character@@ is@@ tic of P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease of the bon@@ e.
Due to the rapid onset of effect of zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid on bone tur@@ no@@ ver, transient hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemia, sometimes symptom@@ ati@@ c@@ , may develop and is usually maxim@@ al within the first 10 days after infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a (see section 4.8).
A@@ de@@ qu@@ ate calcium and vitamin D in@@ take are recommended in association with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a administration.
In addition, in patients with P@@ ag@@ et@@ 's disease, it is stron@@ g@@ ly advised that adequate supplement@@ al calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium t@@ w@@ ice daily is ensured for at least 10 days following A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a administration (see section 4.2).
Patients should be in@@ formed about symptoms of hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemia and receive adequate clinical monitoring during the period of ris@@ k@@ .
Measurement of serum calcium before infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended for patients with P@@ ag@@ et@@ ´s disease.
S@@ e@@ ver@@ e and occa@@ sion@@ ally inc@@ ap@@ ac@@ it@@ ating bon@@ e, joint and/ or muscle pain have been infrequently reported in patients taking b@@ is@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates, including A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a.
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a contains the same active substance found in Z@@ omet@@ a (@@ zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid@@ ), used for onc@@ ology indic@@ ations, and a patient being treated with Z@@ omet@@ a should not be treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a.
O@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rosis of the j@@ a@@ w (@@ O@@ N@@ J@@ ):
O@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rosis of the j@@ a@@ w has been reported predominantly in patients with cancer receiving treatment reg@@ im@@ en@@ s including b@@ is@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates, including zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid@@ .
M@@ any of these patients were also receiving chemotherapy and cor@@ tic@@ o@@ ster@@ o@@ id@@ s.
The maj@@ or@@ ity of reported cases have been associated with d@@ ent@@ al procedures such as to@@ o@@ th ex@@ trac@@ tion.
M@@ any had signs of local infection including o@@ ste@@ om@@ yel@@ iti@@ s.
A d@@ ent@@ al examination with appropriate preven@@ tive d@@ enti@@ str@@ y should be considered prior to treatment with b@@ is@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates in patients with concomitant risk factors (e. g. cancer, chemotherapy, cor@@ tic@@ o@@ ster@@ o@@ id@@ s, poor oral hy@@ gi@@ en@@ e).
Wh@@ ile on treatment, these patients should avoid in@@ v@@ a@@ sive d@@ ent@@ al procedures if possib@@ le.
For patients who develop o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rosis of the j@@ a@@ w while on b@@ is@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy, d@@ ent@@ al surgery may ex@@ ac@@ er@@ b@@ ate the condi@@ tion.
For patients requiring d@@ ent@@ al procedu@@ re@@ s, there are no data available to suggest whether discontinuation of b@@ is@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate treatment reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rosis of the j@@ a@@ w.
The clinical ju@@ dg@@ ement of the treating physician should gu@@ ide the management pl@@ an of each patient based on individual benef@@ it@@ / risk assess@@ ment.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Spec@@ if@@ ic dr@@ ug@@ -@@ drug interaction studies have not been conducted with zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid@@ .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is not system@@ ically metabolised and does not affect human cyto@@ chro@@ me P@@ 450 enzymes in vitro (see section 5.2).
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is not highly bound to plasma protein@@ s (approximately 4@@ 3-@@ 5@@ 5% b@@ ound@@ ) and interactions resulting from dis@@ plac@@ ement of highly protein@@ -@@ bound drugs are therefore unlik@@ el@@ y.
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is elimin@@ ated by renal excre@@ tion.
C@@ a@@ ution is indicated when A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is administered in con@@ j@@ un@@ ction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function (e. g. amin@@ og@@ ly@@ co@@ si@@ d@@ es or di@@ ure@@ tic@@ s that may cause de@@ hyd@@ r@@ ation).
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
There are no adequate data on the use of zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid in pregnant women.
Studies in animals with zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid have shown reproductive toxicological effects including m@@ alf@@ or@@ m@@ ations (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
It is not known whether zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is excreted into human breast milk@@ .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is contraindicated during pregnancy and in breast-feeding women (see section 4.@@ 3@@ ).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
4 4.8 Undesirable effects
The overall perc@@ ent@@ age of patients who experienced post@@ -@@ dose symptoms were 4@@ 4.@@ 7%, 1@@ 6.@@ 7% and 1@@ 0.@@ 2% after the fir@@ st, second and th@@ ir@@ d infusion, respectively.
In@@ c@@ idence of individual symptoms following the first infusion w@@ as@@ : fever (@@ 17@@ .@@ 1@@ %), myal@@ gia (@@ 7@@ .@@ 8@@ %), flu@@ -@@ like symptoms (@@ 6.@@ 7@@ %), ar@@ thralgia (@@ 4.8@@ %) and headache (@@ 5.1@@ %).
The incidence of these symptoms decreased mar@@ k@@ ed@@ ly with subsequent doses of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a.
The maj@@ or@@ ity of these symptoms occur within the first three days following A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a administration.
The maj@@ or@@ ity of these symptoms were mild to moderate and resol@@ ved within three days of the ev@@ ent on@@ se@@ t.
The perc@@ ent@@ age of patients who experienced post@@ -@@ dose symptoms was lower in a small@@ er study (@@ 1@@ 9.@@ 5@@ %, 1@@ 0.@@ 4@@ %, 1@@ 0.@@ 7% after the fir@@ st, second and th@@ ir@@ d infusion, respectivel@@ y@@ ), where prophylaxis against post@@ -@@ dose symptoms was used as described below.
The incidence of post@@ -@@ dose symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced with the administration of par@@ ace@@ ta@@ mo@@ l or i@@ bu@@ prof@@ en short@@ ly following A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a administration (see section 4.2).
In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON – P@@ iv@@ o@@ tal F@@ r@@ act@@ ure T@@ ri@@ al [@@ P@@ F@@ T@@ ] (see section 5.1@@ ), the overall incidence of at@@ ri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ l@@ l@@ ation was 2.@@ 5% (@@ 96 out of 3@@ ,@@ 8@@ 6@@ 2) and 1.@@ 9% (@@ 75 out of 3@@ ,@@ 8@@ 52@@ ) in patients receiving A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and placebo, respectively.
The rate of at@@ ri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ l@@ l@@ ation serious adverse events was increased in patients receiving A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a (@@ 1.@@ 3@@ %) (@@ 51 out of 3@@ ,@@ 8@@ 6@@ 2) compared with patients receiving placebo (@@ 0.@@ 6@@ %) (2@@ 2 out of 3@@ ,@@ 8@@ 5@@ 2).
The mechanism be@@ h@@ in@@ d the increased incidence of at@@ ri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ l@@ l@@ ation is unknown.
In the o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ rosis trials (P@@ F@@ T@@ , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent F@@ r@@ act@@ ure T@@ ri@@ al [@@ RF@@ T@@ ]@@ ) the po@@ ol@@ ed at@@ ri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ l@@ l@@ ation inc@@ id@@ ences were comparable between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a (2@@ .@@ 6@@ %) and placebo (2@@ .@@ 1@@ %).
For at@@ ri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ l@@ l@@ ation serious adverse events the po@@ ol@@ ed inc@@ id@@ ences were 1.3% for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and 0.@@ 8@@ % for placebo.
Very common (≥ 1/ 10@@ ), common (≥ 1/ 100, < 1/ 10@@ ), uncommon (≥ 1/ 1,000, < 1/ 100@@ ), rare (≥ 1/ 10,@@ 000, < 1/ 1,@@ 000@@ ) adverse drug reactions are shown in Table 1.

Class effects:
Renal dy@@ sf@@ un@@ ction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid has been associated with renal dy@@ sf@@ un@@ ction manifest@@ ed as deter@@ i@@ or@@ ation in renal function (i. e. increased serum creatin@@ ine) and in rare cases acute renal failure.
Renal dy@@ sf@@ un@@ ction has been observed following the administration of zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid, especially in patients with pre-existing renal com@@ pro@@ mi@@ se or additional risk factors (e. g onc@@ ology patients with chemotherapy, concomitant ne@@ ph@@ ro@@ toxic medic@@ ations, severe de@@ hyd@@ r@@ ation@@ ), the maj@@ or@@ ity of whom received a 4 mg dose every 3@@ – 4 weeks, but it has been observed in patients after a single administration.
In clinical trials in o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ ro@@ sis, the change in creatinine clearance (@@ measured an@@ n@@ ually prior to dos@@ ing) and the incidence of renal failure and impairment was comparable for both the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and placebo treatment groups over three years.
There was a transient increase in serum creatinine observed within 10 days in 1.@@ 8@@ % of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a@@ -treated patients ver@@ su@@ s 0.@@ 8@@ % of placebo-treated patients.
Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ aemia In clinical trials in o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ ro@@ sis, approximately 0.@@ 2% of patients had no@@ table dec@@ lin@@ es of serum calcium levels (@@ less than 1.@@ 87 mmol/ l) following A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a administration.
No symptomatic cases of hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemia were observed.
In the P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease trials, symptomatic hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemia was observed in approximately 1% of patients, in all of whom it resol@@ ved.
Based on laboratory assess@@ ment@@ , transient as@@ ymptom@@ atic calcium levels below the normal reference range (@@ less than 2.@@ 10 mmol/ l) occurred in 2.@@ 3% of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a@@ -treated patients in a large clinical trial compared to 2@@ 1% of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a@@ -treated patients in the P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease trials.
The frequency of hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemia was much lower following subsequent infusions.
All patients received adequate supplementation with vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ -@@ men@@ o@@ pa@@ us@@ al o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ rosis trial, the prevention of clinical f@@ r@@ act@@ ures after hi@@ p f@@ r@@ act@@ ure trial, and the P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease trials (see also section 4.2).
In the trial for the prevention of clinical f@@ r@@ act@@ ures following a recent hi@@ p f@@ r@@ act@@ ure, vitamin D levels were not rou@@ tin@@ ely measured but the maj@@ or@@ ity of patients received a lo@@ ad@@ ing dose of vitamin D prior to A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a administration (see section 4.2).
L@@ oc@@ al reactions In a large clinical trial, local reactions at the infusion sit@@ e, such as red@@ ness, swelling and/ or pain, were reported (@@ 0.@@ 7@@ %) following the administration of zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid@@ .
6 O@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rosis of the j@@ a@@ w Un@@ common@@ ly, cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rosis (@@ primarily of the j@@ a@@ w@@ ) have been repor@@ ted, predominantly in cancer patients treated with b@@ is@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates, including zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid@@ .
M@@ any of these patients had signs of local infection including o@@ ste@@ om@@ yel@@ itis, and the maj@@ or@@ ity of the reports ref@@ er to cancer patients following to@@ o@@ th ex@@ trac@@ tions or other d@@ ent@@ al surger@@ i@@ es.
O@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rosis of the j@@ a@@ w has multiple well do@@ c@@ um@@ ented risk factors including a diagnosis of cancer, concomitant therap@@ ies (e. g. chemotherapy, radio@@ therapy, cor@@ tic@@ o@@ ster@@ o@@ id@@ s) and co-@@ m@@ orb@@ id conditions (e. g. anaemia, co@@ ag@@ ulo@@ path@@ i@@ es, infection, pre@@ - existing d@@ ent@@ al disease@@ ).
Although ca@@ us@@ ality has not been deter@@ min@@ ed, it is p@@ ru@@ d@@ ent to avoid d@@ ent@@ al surgery as recover@@ y may be prolonged (see section 4.4).
In a large clinical trial in 7@@ ,@@ 7@@ 36 patients, o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rosis of the j@@ a@@ w has been reported in one patient treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and one patient treated with placebo.
B@@ o@@ th cases resol@@ ved.
4.9 Overdose
There is no experience of acute intoxic@@ ation with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a.
Patients who have received doses higher than those recommended should be carefully monitored.
In the ev@@ ent of overdose le@@ ad@@ ing to clinically significant hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemia, re@@ ver@@ sal may be achieved with supplement@@ al oral calcium and/ or an intravenous infusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate.

M@@ ec@@ han@@ ism of action Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid belongs to the cl@@ ass of n@@ it@@ ro@@ gen@@ -@@ containing b@@ is@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates and acts primarily on bon@@ e.
It is an inhibitor of o@@ ste@@ oc@@ l@@ ast@@ -@@ mediated bone re@@ sorp@@ tion.
Pharmacodynamic effects A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment rapidly reduced the rate of bone tur@@ no@@ ver from elevated post@@ -@@ men@@ o@@ pa@@ us@@ al levels with the na@@ di@@ r for re@@ sor@@ ption mar@@ k@@ ers observed at 7 da@@ ys, and for formation mar@@ k@@ ers at 12 weeks.
The@@ re@@ after bone mar@@ k@@ ers stabilised within the pre-@@ men@@ o@@ pa@@ us@@ al range.
There was no progres@@ sive reduction of bone tur@@ no@@ ver mar@@ k@@ ers with repeated an@@ n@@ u@@ al dosing.
Clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ -@@ men@@ o@@ pa@@ us@@ al o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ rosis (P@@ F@@ T@@ ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years were demonstrated in post@@ -@@ men@@ o@@ pa@@ us@@ al women (@@ 7@@ ,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged 6@@ 5@@ – 89 years) with e@@ i@@ ther@@ : a fem@@ oral neck bone min@@ eral den@@ sity (@@ B@@ M@@ D) with a T@@ -@@ s@@ core ≤ – 1.5 and at least two mild or one moderate existing ver@@ te@@ b@@ ral f@@ r@@ act@@ ure@@ (@@ s@@ ); or a fem@@ oral neck B@@ M@@ D T@@ -@@ s@@ core ≤ – 2@@ .5 with or without evidence of existing ver@@ te@@ b@@ ral f@@ r@@ act@@ ure@@ (@@ s).
8@@ 5% of patients were b@@ is@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ e-@@ na@@ ï@@ v@@ e.
Women who were evaluated for the incidence of ver@@ te@@ b@@ ral f@@ r@@ act@@ ures did not receive concomitant o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ rosis therapy, which was allowed for women cont@@ rib@@ uting to the hi@@ p and all clinical f@@ r@@ act@@ ure evalu@@ ations.

Eff@@ ec@@ t on bone min@@ eral den@@ sity (@@ B@@ M@@ D) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a significantly increased B@@ M@@ D at the lu@@ mb@@ ar sp@@ ine, h@@ ip@@ , and dist@@ al radi@@ us relative to treatment with placebo at all ti@@ me@@ po@@ in@@ ts (@@ 6, 12@@ , 24 and 36 month@@ s).
Treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a resulted in a 6.@@ 7% increase in B@@ M@@ D at the lu@@ mb@@ ar sp@@ ine, 6.@@ 0% at the total h@@ ip@@ , 5.1% at the fem@@ oral nec@@ k, and 3.2% at the dist@@ al radi@@ us over 3 years as compared to placebo.

Bone tur@@ no@@ ver mar@@ k@@ ers Bone specific alkaline phosphatase (@@ B@@ SA@@ P@@ ), serum N-@@ terminal pro@@ p@@ ep@@ ti@@ de of type I col@@ l@@ ag@@ en (P@@ 1@@ N@@ P) and serum be@@ ta@@ -C@@ -@@ te@@ lo@@ p@@ ep@@ ti@@ d@@ es (@@ b@@ -C@@ T@@ x@@ ) were evaluated in sub@@ sets ranging from 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 2@@ 46 patients at peri@@ odic intervals throughout the study.
Treatment with a 5 mg an@@ n@@ u@@ al dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a significantly reduced B@@ SA@@ P by 30@@ % relative to baseline at 12 months which was sustained at 28@@ % below baseline levels at 36 month@@ s.

Eff@@ ec@@ t on he@@ ight In the th@@ re@@ e-@@ year o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ rosis study standing he@@ ight was measured an@@ n@@ ually using a st@@ adi@@ omet@@ er.
The A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a group revealed approximately 2@@ .5 m@@ m less he@@ ight loss compared to placebo (95% CI:

Clinical efficacy in the treatment of o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ rosis in patients at increased risk of f@@ r@@ act@@ ure after a recent hi@@ p f@@ r@@ act@@ ure (R@@ F@@ T@@ ) The incidence of clinical f@@ r@@ act@@ ures, including ver@@ te@@ b@@ r@@ al, non-@@ ver@@ te@@ b@@ ral and hi@@ p f@@ r@@ act@@ ures, was evaluated in 2@@ ,@@ 127 men and women aged 50@@ -@@ 95 years (mean age 7@@ 4.5 years) with a recent (@@ within 90 da@@ y@@ s) low@@ - tra@@ um@@ a hi@@ p f@@ r@@ act@@ ure who were followed for an a@@ ver@@ age of 2 years on study medic@@ ation.
Ap@@ pro@@ ximately 4@@ 2% of patients had a fem@@ oral neck B@@ M@@ D T@@ -@@ s@@ core below -@@ 2@@ .5 and approximately 4@@ 5% of the patients had a fem@@ oral neck B@@ M@@ D T@@ -@@ s@@ core above -@@ 2.@@ 5.
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was administered once a year@@ , until at least 2@@ 11 patients in the study population had confirmed clinical f@@ r@@ act@@ ures.
V@@ it@@ am@@ in D levels were not rou@@ tin@@ ely measured but a lo@@ ad@@ ing dose of vitamin D (@@ 5@@ 0,@@ 000 to 12@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000 IU orally or via the intramuscular rout@@ e) was given to the maj@@ or@@ ity of patients 2 weeks prior to infusion.

The study was not designed to measure significant differences in hi@@ p f@@ r@@ act@@ ure, but a t@@ ren@@ d was seen to@@ war@@ ds reduction in new hi@@ p f@@ r@@ act@@ ures.
All cause mortality was 10@@ % (@@ 101 patients) in the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a@@ -treated group compared to 13% (@@ 141 patients) in the placebo group.
This cor@@ respon@@ ds to a 28@@ % reduction in the risk of all cause mortality (@@ p@@ =@@ 0.0@@ 1@@ ).
The incidence of delayed hi@@ p f@@ r@@ act@@ ure heal@@ ing was comparable between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a (@@ 34 [@@ 3.@@ 2@@ %@@ ]@@ ) and placebo (2@@ 9 [@@ 2.@@ 7@@ %@@ ]@@ ).
Eff@@ ec@@ t on bone min@@ eral den@@ sity (@@ B@@ M@@ D) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ O@@ N-@@ RF@@ T study A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment significantly increased B@@ M@@ D at the total hi@@ p and fem@@ oral neck relative to treatment with placebo at all ti@@ me@@ point@@ s.
Treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a resulted in an increase in B@@ M@@ D of 5.@@ 4% at the total hi@@ p and 4.@@ 3% at the fem@@ oral neck over 24 months as compared to placebo.
Clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ O@@ N-@@ RF@@ T study 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised into the study and 18@@ 5 patients had B@@ M@@ D assessed at 24 month@@ s.
At 24 months a similar significant increase of 3.@@ 6% in total hi@@ p B@@ M@@ D was observed for patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a as compared to the effects observed in post@@ -@@ men@@ o@@ pa@@ us@@ al women in the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ O@@ N-@@ P@@ F@@ T study.
The study was not po@@ we@@ red to show a reduction in clinical f@@ r@@ act@@ ures in men@@ ; the incidence of clinical f@@ r@@ act@@ ures was 7@@ .@@ 5% in men treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ver@@ su@@ s 8.@@ 7% for placebo.
In another study in men (@@ study C@@ Z@@ OL@@ 4@@ 4@@ 6@@ M@@ 2@@ 30@@ 8@@ ) an an@@ n@@ u@@ al infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was non-@@ infer@@ i@@ or to weekly al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate for the perc@@ ent@@ age change in lu@@ mb@@ ar sp@@ ine B@@ M@@ D at month 24 relative to base@@ line.
Clinical efficacy in the treatment of P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease of the bone A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was studied in male and female patients aged above 30 years with primarily mild to moderate P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease of the bone (@@ median serum alkaline phosphatase level 2.@@ 6@@ – 3.0 times the upper limit of the ag@@ e-@@ specific normal reference range at the time of study ent@@ r@@ y) confirmed by radi@@ ographic ev@@ id@@ ence@@ .
The efficacy of one infusion of 5 mg zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid ver@@ su@@ s daily doses of 30 mg ri@@ sed@@ ron@@ ate for 2 months was demonstrated in two 6-@@ month comparative trials.
After 6 month@@ s, A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed 9@@ 6% (@@ 16@@ 9@@ / 17@@ 6) and 8@@ 9% (@@ 15@@ 6/ 17@@ 6) response and serum alkaline phosphatase (S@@ A@@ P) normal@@ isation rates compared to 7@@ 4% (@@ 12@@ 7@@ / 17@@ 1@@ ) and 58% (@@ 9@@ 9@@ / 17@@ 1@@ ) for ri@@ sed@@ ron@@ ate (@@ all p < 0.@@ 00@@ 1@@ ).
In the po@@ ol@@ ed resul@@ ts, a similar decrease in pain sever@@ ity and pain inter@@ ference scores relative to baseline were observed over 6 months for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and ri@@ sed@@ ron@@ ate.
10 Patients who were cl@@ as@@ si@@ fied as respon@@ der@@ s at the end of the 6 month core study were el@@ ig@@ ib@@ le to ent@@ er an extended fol@@ low-@@ up period.
O@@ f the 143 A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a@@ -treated patients and 107 ri@@ sed@@ ron@@ at@@ e-treated patients who ent@@ ered an extended obser@@ vation study, after a median duration of fol@@ low-@@ up of 18 months from time of dos@@ ing, 141 A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a@@ -treated patients maintained their therapeutic response compared to 71 ri@@ sed@@ ron@@ at@@ e-treated patients.
This cor@@ respon@@ ds to a 9@@ 6% reduction of risk of relapse in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ver@@ su@@ s ri@@ sed@@ ron@@ at@@ e-treated patients.
Bone hist@@ ology was evaluated in 7 patients with P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease 6 months after treatment with 5 mg zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid@@ .
Bone biopsy results showed bone of normal quality with no evidence of impaired bone remo@@ d@@ elling and no evidence of min@@ er@@ al@@ isation def@@ ec@@ ts.
These results were consistent with bio@@ chemical mar@@ k@@ er evidence of normal@@ isation of bone tur@@ no@@ ver.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Sing@@ le and multiple 5 and 15@@ -minute infu@@ sions of 2@@ , 4, 8 and 16 mg zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmacokinetic dat@@ a, which were found to be dose in@@ depend@@ ent.
After initiation of the zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid infusion, plasma concentrations of the active substance increased rapid@@ ly, achiev@@ ing their peak at the end of the infusion period, followed by a rapid dec@@ line to < 10@@ % of peak after 4 hours and < 1% of peak after 24 h@@ ours, with a subsequent prolonged period of very low concentrations not exceeding 0.@@ 1% of peak level@@ s.
Intra@@ ven@@ ously administered zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is elimin@@ ated by a t@@ rip@@ ha@@ si@@ c pro@@ c@@ es@@ s: rapid b@@ ip@@ ha@@ si@@ c dis@@ appearance from the systemic cir@@ cul@@ ation, with half-lives of t@@ ½@@ α 0.@@ 24 and t@@ ½@@ β 1.@@ 87 h@@ ours, followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination half-life of t@@ ½@@ γ 146 hours.
There was no accumulation of the active substance in plasma after multiple doses given every 28 days.
The early dis@@ position pha@@ ses (@@ α and β@@ , with t@@ ½ values ab@@ o@@ ve@@ ) pre@@ su@@ m@@ ably repres@@ ent rapid uptake into bone and excre@@ tion via the kidne@@ ys.
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is not metabolised and is excreted unchanged via the kidne@@ y.
O@@ ver the first 24 h@@ ours, 39 ± 1@@ 6% of the administered dose is recovered in the urine, while the remain@@ der is pr@@ inc@@ ip@@ ally bound to bone tissu@@ e.
F@@ ro@@ m the bone tissue it is re@@ le@@ ased very slowly back into the systemic cir@@ c@@ ulation and elimin@@ ated via the kidne@@ y.
The total body clearance is 5.@@ 0@@ 4 ± 2@@ .5 l/ h@@ , in@@ dependent of dose, and un@@ affec@@ ted by gender, age, r@@ ace or body weigh@@ t.
The inter@@ - and intra-@@ subject vari@@ ation for plasma clearance of zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid was shown to be 3@@ 6% and 3@@ 4@@ %, respectively.
In@@ cre@@ asing the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes caused a 30@@ % decrease in zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid concentration at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the area under the plasma concentration ver@@ su@@ s time cur@@ v@@ e.
No specific dr@@ ug@@ -@@ drug interaction studies have been conducted with zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid@@ .
Since zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is not metabolised in humans and the substance was found to have lit@@ t@@ le or no capac@@ ity as a di@@ rect@@ - ac@@ ting and/ or irreversible metabolism@@ -@@ dependent inhibitor of P@@ 450 enzym@@ es, zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is unlikely to reduce the metabolic clearance of subst@@ ances which are metabolised via the cyto@@ chro@@ me P@@ 450 enzym@@ e system@@ s.
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is not highly bound to plasma protein@@ s (approximately 4@@ 3-@@ 5@@ 5% b@@ ound@@ ) and binding is concentration in@@ depend@@ ent.
Therefore, interactions resulting from dis@@ plac@@ ement of highly protein@@ -@@ bound drugs are unlik@@ el@@ y.
Special populations (see section 4.@@ 2) The renal clearance of zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid was cor@@ related with creatinine cle@@ ar@@ ance, renal clearance repres@@ en@@ ting 75 ± 33% of the creatinine cle@@ ar@@ ance, which showed a mean of 84 ± 29 ml/ m@@ in (@@ range 22 to 143 ml/ min@@ ) in the 64 patients studi@@ ed.
S@@ m@@ all observed increases in AU@@ C@@ (0@@ -@@ 2@@ 4@@ h@@ r@@ ), by about 30@@ % to 40% in mild to moderate renal impairment, compared to a patient with normal renal function, and lack of accumulation of drug with multiple doses ir@@ respec@@ tive of renal function, suggest that dose adjustments of zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid in mild (C@@ l@@ c@@ r = 50@@ – 80 ml/ min@@ ) and moderate renal impairment down to a creatinine clearance of 35 ml/ m@@ in are not necessary.
As only limited data are available in severe renal impairment (@@ creatinine clearance < 30 ml/ min@@ ), no dosing recommendations are possible for this population.
11 5.3 Preclinical safety data
A@@ c@@ ute toxicity The highest non-@@ le@@ th@@ al single intravenous dose was 10 mg/ kg body weight in mic@@ e and 0.6 mg/ kg in rat@@ s.
In the single-dose do@@ g infusion studies, 1.0 mg/ kg (@@ 6 fol@@ d the recommended human therapeutic exposure based on AUC) administered over 15 minutes was well toler@@ ated with no renal effects.
S@@ ub@@ chronic and chronic toxicity In the intravenous infusion studies, renal toler@@ ability of zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid was established in rats when given 0.6 mg/ kg as 15@@ -minute infu@@ sions at 3-@@ day interval@@ s, six times in total (for a cumulative dose that cor@@ responded to AUC levels about 6 times the human therapeutic expo@@ sure@@ ) while five 15@@ -minute infu@@ sions of 0.@@ 25 mg/ kg administered at 2@@ – 3@@ -week intervals (a cumulative dose that cor@@ responded to 7 times the human therapeutic expo@@ sure@@ ) were well toler@@ ated in do@@ g@@ s.
In the intravenous bolus studies, the doses that were well@@ -@@ toler@@ ated decreased with increasing study dur@@ ation:
0.@@ 2 and 0.0@@ 2 mg/ kg daily was well toler@@ ated for 4 weeks in rats and do@@ g@@ s, respec@@ tiv@@ ely but only 0.0@@ 1 mg/ kg and 0.@@ 005 mg/ kg in rats and do@@ g@@ s, respectively, when given for 5@@ 2 weeks.
Lon@@ ger@@ -term repe@@ at administration at cumulative exposures sufficiently exceeding the maximum intended human exposure produced toxicological effects in other organ@@ s, including the g@@ astrointestinal tract and liver, and at the site of intravenous administration.
The clinical relevance of these findings is unknown.
The most frequent finding in the repeat-dose studies consi@@ st@@ ed of increased primary sp@@ on@@ gi@@ os@@ a in the me@@ t@@ ap@@ hy@@ ses of long bon@@ es in g@@ row@@ ing animals at ne@@ arly all doses, a finding that ref@@ l@@ ec@@ ted the comp@@ ound@@ ’ s pharmacological anti@@ re@@ sorp@@ tive activ@@ ity.
Reproduction toxicity T@@ er@@ at@@ ology studies were performed in two speci@@ es, both via subcutaneous administration.
T@@ er@@ at@@ ogenicity was observed in rats at doses ≥ 0.@@ 2 mg/ kg and was manifest@@ ed by ex@@ tern@@ al, v@@ isc@@ eral and skelet@@ al m@@ alf@@ or@@ m@@ ations.
D@@ yst@@ oc@@ ia was observed at the lowest dose (@@ 0.0@@ 1 mg/ kg body weigh@@ t@@ ) test@@ ed in rat@@ s.
No terat@@ ological or emb@@ r@@ y@@ o@@ / foetal effects were observed in rabb@@ it@@ s, although maternal toxicity was marked at 0.@@ 1 mg/ kg due to decreased serum calcium level@@ s.
M@@ u@@ tagenicity and carcinogenic potential Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ronic acid was not mu@@ ta@@ gen@@ ic in the mutagenicity tests performed and carcinogenicity t@@ es@@ ting did not provide any evidence of carcinogenic poten@@ ti@@ al.

Further information
1.
WHAT AC@@ LA@@ ST@@ A IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is given as a single infusion into a vein by a doctor or nur@@ se.
It belongs to a group of medicines called b@@ is@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates and is used to treat o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ rosis in post@@ -@@ men@@ o@@ pa@@ us@@ al wom@@ en, o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ rosis in men and P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease of the bon@@ e.
O@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ rosis O@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ rosis is a disease that invol@@ v@@ es the thin@@ ning and weak@@ en@@ ing of the bon@@ es and is common in women after the men@@ o@@ pa@@ use, but can also occur in m@@ en.
At the men@@ o@@ pa@@ use, a wom@@ an@@ ’ s ov@@ ar@@ ies sto@@ p produc@@ ing the female hormone o@@ e@@ stro@@ gen@@ , which hel@@ p@@ s keep bon@@ es health@@ y.
Following the men@@ o@@ pa@@ use bone loss occurs, bon@@ es become weak@@ er and bre@@ ak more e@@ a@@ si@@ ly.
M@@ any patients with o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ rosis have no symptoms but they are sti@@ l@@ l at risk of bre@@ ak@@ ing bon@@ es because o@@ ste@@ o@@ po@@ rosis has made their bon@@ es weak@@ er.
Decreased cir@@ cul@@ ating levels of sex hormon@@ es, main@@ ly o@@ e@@ stro@@ gen@@ s con@@ verted from and@@ ro@@ gen@@ s, also play a role in the more gradu@@ al bone loss observed in m@@ en.
In both women and m@@ en, A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a st@@ reng@@ then@@ s the bone and therefore makes it less lik@@ ely to bre@@ ak@@ .
Because A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a wor@@ ks for a long ti@@ me, you will not need another dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for a year@@ .
P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease of the bone It is normal that old bone is remo@@ ved and is replac@@ ed with new bone mater@@ i@@ al.
This pro@@ c@@ ess is called re@@ model@@ lin@@ g.
In P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease, bone remo@@ d@@ elling is too rapid and new bone is formed in a dis@@ or@@ de@@ red fa@@ shi@@ on, which makes it weak@@ er than normal@@ .
If the disease is not treated, bon@@ es may become de@@ formed and pa@@ inf@@ ul@@ , and may bre@@ ak@@ .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a wor@@ ks by returning the bone remo@@ d@@ elling pro@@ c@@ ess to normal, se@@ cur@@ ing formation of normal bon@@ e, th@@ us rest@@ oring st@@ rength to the bon@@ e.

POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS
Like all medicines, A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
In most cases, no specific treatment is required.
S@@ ide effects related to the first infusion are very common (@@ occurring in more than 30@@ % of patients) but are less common following subsequent infusions.
The maj@@ or@@ ity of the side effects, such as fever and ch@@ ill@@ s, pain in the muscles or jo@@ int@@ s, and headache, occur within the first three days following the dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a.

31 INFORMATION FOR THE H@@ EA@@ L@@ TH@@ CAR@@ E PRO@@ F@@ ES@@ SI@@ O@@ N@@ AL
The following information is intended for medical or healthcare professionals on@@ ly:
The dose of 5 mg of zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid must be administered over at least 15 minut@@ es.
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for patients with severe renal impairment (@@ creatinine clearance < 35 ml/ min@@ ) due to lack of adequate clinical experience in this population.
Patients should have their serum creatinine level measured before receiving A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a.
In patients with a recent low-@@ tra@@ um@@ a hi@@ p f@@ r@@ act@@ ure, it is recommended to g@@ ive the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a infusion two or more weeks after hi@@ p f@@ r@@ act@@ ure re@@ pa@@ ir@@ .
Patients must be appropriately hyd@@ rated prior to and following administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a@@ ; this is especially important for patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy.
C@@ a@@ ution is indicated when A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is administered in con@@ j@@ un@@ ction with medicinal products that can significantly impact renal function (e. g. amin@@ og@@ ly@@ co@@ si@@ d@@ es or di@@ ure@@ tic@@ s that may cause de@@ hyd@@ r@@ ation).
Pre@@ -@@ existing hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemia must be treated by adequate in@@ take of calcium and vitamin D before initiating therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a.
Other disturb@@ ances of min@@ eral metabolism must also be effec@@ tiv@@ ely treated (e. g. di@@ mini@@ shed parath@@ yroid re@@ ser@@ v@@ e, intestinal calcium mal@@ absor@@ p@@ tion@@ ).
P@@ hy@@ si@@ ci@@ ans should consi@@ der clinical monitoring for these patients.
E@@ lev@@ ated bone tur@@ no@@ ver is a character@@ is@@ tic of P@@ ag@@ et@@ ’ s disease of the bon@@ e.
Due to the rapid onset of effect of zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid on bone tur@@ no@@ ver, transient hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemia, sometimes symptom@@ ati@@ c@@ , may develop and is usually maxim@@ al within the first 10 days after infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a.
A@@ de@@ qu@@ ate calcium and vitamin D in@@ take are recommended in association with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a administration.
In addition, in patients with P@@ ag@@ et@@ 's disease, it is stron@@ g@@ ly advised that adequate supplement@@ al calcium corresponding to at least 500 mg elemental calcium t@@ w@@ ice daily is ensured for at least 10 days following A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a administration.
Patients should be in@@ formed about symptoms of hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ aemia and receive adequate clinical monitoring during the period of ris@@ k@@ .
Measurement of serum calcium before infusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended for patients with P@@ ag@@ et@@ ´s disease.
In patients with a recent low-@@ tra@@ um@@ a hi@@ p f@@ r@@ act@@ ure, a lo@@ ad@@ ing dose of 5@@ 0,@@ 000 to 12@@ 5@@ ,@@ 000 IU of vitamin D given orally or via the intramuscular route is recommended prior to the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a infusion.
How to prepare and administer A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a
- A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg solution for infusion is ready for use.
For single use on@@ ly.
Any unused solution should be discar@@ ded.
Only cle@@ ar solution f@@ ree from particles and discolor@@ ation should be used.
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be mixed or given intravenously with any other medic@@ ation and must be given through a se@@ par@@ ate vented infusion line at a con@@ stant infusion rate.
The infusion time must not be less than 15 minut@@ es.
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be allowed to com@@ e into contact with any cal@@ ci@@ um@@ -@@ containing solu@@ tion@@ s.
If refriger@@ at@@ ed, allow the refrigerated solution to reach ro@@ om temperature before administration.
A@@ se@@ ptic techn@@ i@@ qu@@ es must be followed during pre@@ par@@ ation of the infusion.
The infusion must be conducted according to standard medical prac@@ ti@@ ce@@ .
How to store A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a
- Keep A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a out of the reach and sight of children.
- Do not use A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a after the expiry date which is stated on the carton and bottle.
- The u@@ nopened bottle does not require any special storage conditions.
- After opening the bott@@ le, the product should be used immediately in order to avoid micro@@ b@@ ial
con@@ ta@@ min@@ ation.
If not used immediately, in@@ -@@ use storage times and conditions prior to use are the respon@@ sib@@ ility of the use@@ r and would nor@@ m@@ ally not be longer than 24 hours at 2°C - 8@@ °C.

ut@@ h EPAR summary for the public
r@@ a This document is a summary of the European P@@ u@@ bl@@ ic Assessment Report (EP@@ AR@@ ).
It explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) assessed the studies performed, to reach their recommendations on how to use the medicine.
If you need more information about your medical condition or your treatment, read the Package
What is AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A@@ ?
AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A is a medicine containing the active substance ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant.
It is available as whit@@ e, te@@ ar@@ drop@@ - sha@@ p@@ ed tablets. no
What is AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A used for?
AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A is used t@@ og@@ e@@ ther with di@@ e@@ t and exer@@ ci@@ se to treat adult patients: • who are o@@ be@@ se (very over@@ weigh@@ t@@ ) with a body m@@ ass in@@ de@@ x (@@ B@@ M@@ I) greater than or equal to 30 kg/ m@@ ²@@ , • who are over@@ weight (with a B@@ M@@ I greater than or equal to 27 kg/ m@@ ²@@ ) and also have other risk factors, c@@ t
such as type 2 diabetes or dys@@ lip@@ id@@ aemia (@@ abnormal levels of fat in their blood@@ ).
The medicine can only be obtained with a prescription. d@@ u
How is AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A used?
AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A is taken as one tablet once a day, before bre@@ ak@@ fast@@ .
The medicine should not be used in patients who r@@ o
have severe problems with their liver or their kidne@@ ys. l@@ p
How does AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A work?
The active substance in AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A, ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant, is a can@@ n@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ id receptor antagon@@ ist@@ .
It acts by blo@@ c@@ king a specific type of recept@@ or, the can@@ n@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ id type 1 (C@@ B@@ 1@@ ) receptors.
The receptors are ina
also found in adi@@ po@@ cy@@ tes (@@ fat tissu@@ e).
How has AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A been studied?
The effects of AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A were first test@@ ed in experimental models before being studied in humans. dic
F@@ our studies of AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A in over@@ weight and o@@ be@@ se patients were carried ou@@ t, involving al@@ most 7@@ ,@@ 000 patients, whose weight at the start of the studies was on a@@ ver@@ age 9@@ 4 to 104 k@@ g.

d over one to two years.
On@@ e study also looked at how this loss could be maintained during the second year@@ .
ise F@@ our studies of AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A as a help to sto@@ p smoking were also carried out in over 7@@ ,@@ 000 patients, comparing it with placebo, and measuring the effect of the medicine given for 10 weeks (@@ one year in one of the studies) on smoking c@@ ess@@ ation, and on relap@@ ses in the following year@@ .
or What benefit has AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A shown during the studies?
After one year@@ , all patients who received AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A lo@@ st more weight than those who received placebo@@ : they lo@@ st on a@@ ver@@ age 4.9 kg more than placebo, except in the study in diabetic patients, where the
ut@@ h difference in the weight loss was 3.@@ 9 k@@ g.
The medicine also reduced the risk of reg@@ ain@@ ing weigh@@ t.
The studies in smoking c@@ ess@@ ation did not show consistent resul@@ ts, and the effect of AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A in this area was difficult to estim@@ ate.
The company decided to withdra@@ w its applic@@ ation for smoking c@@ ess@@ ation.
Therefore, AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A is not recommended as an aid for smoking c@@ ess@@ ation
During the studies, the most common side effects with AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A (seen in more than 1 patient in 10) were nausea (feeling sick@@ ) and infec@@ tions of the upper respiratory tr@@ act@@ .
For the full list of all side effects
ge reported with AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A, see the Package Leaflet.
AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant or any of the other ingredi@@ ents, or in women who are breast fee@@ d@@ ing.
It must also not be used in patients with on@@ going major depression or who are being treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ant@@ s, since it can increase the risk of l@@ on depres@@ sion, including thoughts about suicide in a s@@ m@@ all min@@ or@@ ity of patients.
Patients who experience symptoms of depression should spe@@ ak to their doctor and may need to sto@@ p treatment.
C@@ a@@ ution should be used when taking AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A with some medicines, such as ketoconazole or itraconazole (@@ anti@@ -f@@ un@@ gal medicin@@ es), rit@@ on@@ a@@ vi@@ r (@@ used in HIV infec@@ tion), or t@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ c@@ in or c@@ lar@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ c@@ in (@@ anti@@ bio@@ tic@@ s). no
Why has AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A been approved?
The Committee for Medicinal products for Human Use (CHMP) conclu@@ ded that AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A had shown its effectiveness in weight reduction in o@@ be@@ se or over@@ weight patients with associated risk factors.
The Committee decided that AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A@@ ’ s benefits are greater than its risks when use@@ d, in addition to di@@ e@@ t and c@@ t
exer@@ ci@@ se, to treat o@@ be@@ se patients and over@@ weight patients with risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dys@@ lip@@ id@@ aem@@ ia.
The Committee recommended that AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A be given marketing authorisation. d@@ u
The company that makes AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A will pu@@ t in place a programme to ensure that the medicine is used in patients who need it for health@@ , ra@@ ther than for co@@ s@@ m@@ etic reason@@ s, by prov@@ iding educational pack@@ s for r@@ o
patients and doctor@@ s, and to monit@@ or how the medicine is used.
The company will use specific dat@@ ab@@ ase@@ s to monit@@ or AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A@@ ’ s side effects, especially those lin@@ ked to the nerv@@ ous system@@ . l@@ p

On@@ going major depres@@ sive illness and/ or on@@ going anti@@ depres@@ sive treatment (see section 4.4)
ise 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
• De@@ pres@@ sive disorders
or De@@ pres@@ sive disorders or mood al@@ ter@@ ations with depres@@ sive symptoms have been reported in up to 10@@ %, and suicidal ide@@ ation in up to 1@@ %, of patients receiving ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant (see section 4.8).
In patients with current suicidal ide@@ ations and/ or with a history of suicidal ide@@ ation and depres@@ sive disorder ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant
ut@@ h should not be used unless the benefits of treatment are considered to outweigh these risks in an individual patient.
(See section 4.3 and 4.8).
O@@ b@@ es@@ ity is a condition that can be associated with depres@@ sive disorder@@ s.
De@@ pres@@ sive disorders can be associated with an increased risk of suicidal though@@ ts, se@@ l@@ f harm and suicide@@ .
r@@ a The presc@@ rib@@ er should carefully investig@@ ate if the patient has had a depres@@ sive disorder in the p@@ ast in order to evaluate the potential risks with ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant treatment.
ge De@@ pres@@ sive reactions may occur in patients who have no ob@@ vi@@ ous risk factors, ap@@ art from obesity it@@ se@@ lf@@ .
In post@@ marketing experience, more than half of the patients who develop such reactions appear to do so within 1 month of starting treatment, approximately 8@@ 0% appear to do so within 3 month@@ s. l@@ on Patients should be activ@@ ely monitored for signs and symptoms of p@@ sychiatric disorder@@ s, particularly depression following the start of treatment.
The patient should be monitored and treated appropri@@ atel@@ y.
P@@ ati@@ ents, especially those with a history of depres@@ sive disorder@@ s@@ / mood al@@ ter@@ ations, (@@ and rel@@ ati@@ v@@ es or no
other relevant per@@ son@@ s) should be al@@ er@@ ted about the need to monit@@ or for the em@@ erg@@ ence of such symptoms and to seek medical advice immediately if these occur.
• Other p@@ sychiatric conditions c@@ t
Therap@@ y with ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant is not recommended in patients with un@@ controlled p@@ sychiatric illnes@@ s.
If p@@ sychiatric illness is diag@@ no@@ sed during ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant therapy, treatment must be stopp@@ ed. d@@ u
• Seiz@@ ures R@@ im@@ on@@ ab@@ ant has not been studied in patients being treated for ep@@ ilep@@ sy@@ .
R@@ im@@ on@@ ab@@ ant, r@@ o
ho@@ wever, should be used with caution in these patients, see also section 5.@@ 3.
• Hepatic impairment l@@ p
R@@ im@@ on@@ ab@@ ant is metabolised by the liver, th@@ us caution is advised in patients with moderate hepatic impairment.
The pharmacokinetics and safety of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant have not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment@@ ; its use in these patients is not recommended. ina
• Renal impairment There are limited data in patients with moderate renal impairment and no data in patients with severe renal impairment.
R@@ im@@ on@@ ab@@ ant should not be used in patients with severe renal impairment (see section dic
4.2 and 5.2).
• Elderly The efficacy and safety of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant treatment in patients over 75 years of age has not sufficiently M@@ e
R@@ im@@ on@@ ab@@ ant should be used with caution in this population (see section 5.2).
d (see section 5.2).
ise • Di@@ ab@@ etic patients
Due to the effect of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant on the blood glucose level@@ , when ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant is administered in diabetic patients, hypo@@ gly@@ ce@@ am@@ ia can occur (see section 4.8).
M@@ on@@ it@@ oring of blood glucose level is
or recommended in these patients.
• D@@ ru@@ g Interaction
ut@@ h R@@ im@@ on@@ ab@@ ant should be used with caution in combination with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e. g. ketocona@@ zol@@ e, it@@ racon@@ a@@ zol@@ e, rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir@@ , t@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ c@@ in, c@@ lar@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ c@@ in, ne@@ fa@@ z@@ o@@ don@@ e@@ )@@ (see section 4.5).
• Lactose
r@@ a Since AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A tablets contain lac@@ to@@ se, patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the L@@ ap@@ p lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose mal@@ absor@@ p@@ tion, should not take this medicine.
ge Patients should be in@@ str@@ u@@ c@@ ted not to increase their dose of AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A.
Patients who had a cardiovascular ev@@ ent (@@ myocardial infarction, stroke, etc@@ .@@ ) less than 6 months ag@@ o l@@ on were excluded in the studies for ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
R@@ im@@ on@@ ab@@ ant is metaboliz@@ ed by both CYP@@ 3@@ A and am@@ i@@ do@@ hydro@@ l@@ ase (@@ predominantly hepati@@ c@@ ) pathways in no
Con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors will lead to increased exposure of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant.
Con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of CYP3A4 inducers is expected to reduce the exposure of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant. c@@ t
Potential for other medicinal products to affect ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant@@ :
Con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of ketoconazole (a potent CYP3A4 inhibit@@ or@@ ) increased ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant AUC d@@ u
by 10@@ 4% (95% pre@@ dic@@ tion interval@@ :
40% - 1@@ 97@@ %).
A similar increase in exposure is expected with other potent CYP3A4 inhibit@@ ors.
C@@ a@@ ution is advised during concomitant use of AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A and potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e. g. ketocona@@ zol@@ e, it@@ racon@@ a@@ zol@@ e, rit@@ on@@ av@@ ir@@ , t@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ c@@ in, c@@ lar@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ c@@ in, ne@@ fa@@ z@@ o@@ don@@ e). r@@ o
Although concomitant administration of CYP3A4 inducers (e. g. ri@@ fam@@ p@@ ic@@ in, phen@@ yto@@ in, phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ it@@ al, carbamazepine, S@@ t J@@ ohn@@ ’ s w@@ ort) has not been studi@@ ed, it is expected that concomitant administration of potent CYP3A4 inducers may reduce the plasma concentration of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant and may result in loss of l@@ p
eff@@ icac@@ y.
Con@@ com@@ it@@ ant administration of or@@ list@@ at, e@@ th@@ an@@ ol or lorazepam had no significant effect on the plasma ina
levels of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant.
Potential for ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant to affect other medicinal products:
The in vivo inhibit@@ ory effect on CYP2C8 has not been studi@@ ed.

Animal data are in@@ conclu@@ sive but
d suggest possible del@@ et@@ er@@ i@@ ous effects on emb@@ r@@ y@@ on@@ al@@ / foetal development (see section 5.3).
The potential risk for humans is unknown.
Use in pregnancy is, the@@ refore, not recommended.
Patients should notify
ise their physician if they become pregnant during treatment with AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A.
R@@ im@@ on@@ ab@@ ant has been detected in the milk of lactating rats and ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant may in@@ hibit the su@@ ck@@ ling refle@@ x.
It is not known if ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant is excreted in human milk@@ .
AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A is contraindicated during
or breast-feeding (see section 4.@@ 3@@ ).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ut@@ h No studies on the effects on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed.
C@@ og@@ ni@@ tive investig@@ ations in clinical pharmac@@ ology studies demonstrated that ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant is de@@ vo@@ id of any significant c@@ og@@ ni@@ tive or sed@@ ative effec@@ t.
r@@ a 4.8 Undesirable effects
AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A 20 mg has been evaluated for safety in approximately 25@@ 00 patients en@@ ro@@ l@@ led in studies
ge that examined the metabolic and weight loss effects in over@@ weight and o@@ be@@ se patients and in approximately 38@@ 00 patients in other indications.
In placebo-controlled studies, the discontinuation rate due to adverse reactions was 15.7% for patients receiving ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant.
The most common adverse l@@ on reactions resulting in discontinuation we@@ re@@ : nausea, mood al@@ ter@@ ation with depres@@ sive symptoms, depres@@ sive disorder@@ s, anxiety and dizz@@ in@@ es@@ s.
De@@ pres@@ sive disorders were reported in 3.2% of o@@ be@@ se patients, or over@@ weight patients with associated risk fact@@ or@@ (@@ s) treated with ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg.
These were usually mild or moderate in sever@@ ity and no
resulted in recover@@ y in all cases either after correc@@ tive treatment or discontinuation of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant and did not exhibit any differentiating characteristics compared to cases reported in the control group@@ s.
The following table (@@ table 1@@ ) show@@ s all treatment@@ -@@ emergent adverse reactions from placebo-controlled c@@ t
studies in patients treated for weight loss and related metabolic disorders when these inc@@ id@@ ences were statistically significantly greater than the corresponding placebo rate (for events ≥ 1@@ %) or considered clinically relevant (for events < 1@@ %). d@@ u

r@@ a M@@ os@@ t of the observed weight reduction was obtained within the first nine months of treatment.
AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A 20 mg was effective in maintaining weight loss up to two years.
Weight loss at two years

Patients who received AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A 20 mg for one year were re@@ -@@ randomiz@@ ed to AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A 20 mg or placebo.
At two year@@ s, patients continuing on ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant had a mean total weight loss of 7.5 kg over 2 years whe@@ re@@ as patients re@@ -@@ randomiz@@ ed to placebo group during the second year had a mean total weight loss of 3.@@ 1 kg over 2 years.

Treatment with ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant was associated with significant reductions in wa@@ ist cir@@ c@@ um@@ fe@@ rence, a known mar@@ k@@ er of intra-@@ abdominal fat@@ . c@@ t
The effects on body weight appeared to be consistent among men and women.
In the limited number of B@@ lack patients weight loss was less p@@ ron@@ oun@@ c@@ ed (mean difference to placebo -@@ 2.@@ 9 k@@ g@@ ).
No d@@ u
conclusions can be dra@@ wn with regard to effects in patients over 75 years or in A@@ si@@ an@@ / O@@ ri@@ ent@@ al patients due to the low number of patients. r@@ o
For l@@ p
H@@ D@@ L@@ -@@ C an a@@ ver@@ age increase of 1@@ 6.@@ 4% was seen under ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg (@@ baseline H@@ D@@ L@@ -@@ C 1.@@ 24 mmol/ l) compared to an increase of 8.@@ 9% for placebo (@@ baseline H@@ D@@ L@@ -@@ C 1.@@ 21 mmol/ l).
For the ina
tri@@ glyc@@ er@@ id@@ es an a@@ ver@@ age decrease of 6.@@ 9% was seen under ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg (@@ baseline T@@ G 1.@@ 62 mmol/ l) compared to an increase of 5.@@ 8@@ % for placebo (@@ baseline T@@ G 1.@@ 65 mmol/ l).
The difference was statistically significant (@@ Diff@@ eren@@ ce -@@ 13.@@ 3% CI@@ 95% -@@ 1@@ 6.@@ 5@@ ; -@@ 1@@ 0.@@ 2% p < 0.@@ 00@@ 1@@ ).
It is estimated that approximately half of the observed improvement in H@@ D@@ L@@ -@@ C and tri@@ glyc@@ er@@ id@@ es in patients who received dic
ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg was beyond that expected from weight loss alone.
Gener@@ ally AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A 20 mg had no significant effect on T@@ o@@ tal@@ -@@ C or L@@ D@@ L@@ -@@ C level@@ s.
In the trial in type 2 diabetic patients (R@@ I@@ O-@@ Di@@ ab@@ et@@ es) who were over@@ weight or o@@ be@@ se treated with M@@ e
The absolute change in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c at one year was -@@ 0.6 for ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg (@@ baseline 7@@ .@@ 3@@ %) and +@@ 0.@@ 1 on placebo (@@ baseline 7@@ .@@ 2@@ %).
Diff@@ eren@@ c@@ es were statistically significant (@@ Diff@@ eren@@ ce -@@ 0.@@ 7%, CI@@ 95% -@@ 0.@@ 80@@ ; -@@ 0.@@ 5@@ , p < 0.@@ 00@@ 1@@ ).
8 At one year a mean weight loss of 5.3 kg was shown for AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A 20 mg ver@@ su@@ s a loss on placebo of 1.@@ 4 kg (@@ Diff@@ eren@@ ce – 3.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95% -@@ 4.@@ 6@@ ; -@@ 3.@@ 3 p < 0.@@ 00@@ 1@@ ).
The perc@@ ent@@ age of patients who lo@@ st 5% and 10@@ % of their baseline body weight after 1 year of treatment are given in the table 2.
d In a second trial in treatment na@@ ï@@ ve type 2 diabetic o@@ be@@ se patients (S@@ eren@@ ad@@ e), the absolute change in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c (with a baseline of 7@@ .@@ 9% for both group@@ s) at six months was -@@ 0.8 for ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and

The perc@@ ent@@ age of patients reach@@ ing H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c < 7% was 5@@ 1% in the ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant group and 35@@ % in the placebo group.
The difference in mean body weight change between the 20 mg and placebo groups was 3.@@ 8 kg (@@ CI@@ 95% -@@ 5.@@ 0, -@@ 2.@@ 6 p < 0.@@ 00@@ 1@@ ).
Changes in H@@ D@@ L@@ -@@ C and T@@ G in this population were similar to that of the non-@@ diabetic population.
It is
or estimated that approximately half of the mean improvement in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c in patients receiving ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg was beyond that expected from weight loss alone.
ut@@ h 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
R@@ im@@ on@@ ab@@ ant pharmacokinetics are f@@ air@@ ly dose propor@@ tional up to about 20 mg.
AUC increased less than in proportion to dose above 20 mg.
r@@ a Absorption:
R@@ im@@ on@@ ab@@ ant dis@@ pla@@ ys high in vitro per@@ me@@ ability and is not a subst@@ rate of P@@ -@@ glyco@@ protein.
The absolute bioavailability of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant has not been deter@@ min@@ ed.
Following multiple once-@@ daily doses of 20 mg
ge to healthy subjects in the fast@@ ed state, maximum plasma concentrations of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant are achieved in approximately 2 hours with steady state plasma levels achieved within 13 days (@@ Cmax = 1@@ 96 ± 2@@ 8.1 ng/ m@@ l@@ ; C@@ trou@@ g@@ h = 9@@ 1.@@ 6 ± 1@@ 4.1 ng/ m@@ l@@ ; AU@@ C@@ 0@@ -@@ 24 = 2@@ 9@@ 60 ± 26@@ 8 n@@ g. h@@ / ml).
S@@ te@@ ad@@ y state ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant l@@ on exposures are 3.@@ 3-@@ fol@@ d higher than those observed after the first dose.
Population pharmacokinetic analysis demonstrated less fluctu@@ ation in peak to trou@@ g@@ h plasma concentration but no differences in steady state AUC as weight increase@@ s.
As weight increases from 65 to 200 kg, Cmax is expected to decrease 2@@ 4% and C@@ trou@@ g@@ h is expected to increase by 5@@ %.
Population no
pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant pharmacokinetics are similar between healthy non-@@ smoking subjects and patients who smok@@ e.
Administration of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant to healthy subjects in the fast@@ ed state or with a high fat meal demonstrated that Cmax and AUC were increased 6@@ 7% and 4@@ 8@@ % respectively, under f@@ ed conditions.
In clinical studies, AC@@ O@@ M@@ P@@ LI@@ A 20 mg was taken in the m@@ or@@ ning usually before bre@@ ak@@ fast@@ . d@@ u
Distribution:
The in vitro human plasma protein binding of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant is high (> 9@@ 9.@@ 9@@ %) and non-@@ s@@ at@@ u@@ rable over a r@@ o
w@@ ide concentration range.
The apparent peripheral volume of distribution of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant appe@@ ar@@ s to be related to body weight, with o@@ be@@ se patients having a higher volume of distribution than normal@@ -@@ weight subjects. l@@ p
Bio@@ trans@@ form@@ ation:
R@@ im@@ on@@ ab@@ ant is metaboliz@@ ed by both CYP@@ 3@@ A and am@@ i@@ do@@ hydro@@ l@@ ase (@@ predominantly hepati@@ c@@ ) pathways in ina
C@@ ir@@ cul@@ ating metabolites do not cont@@ rib@@ ute to its pharmac@@ ologic activ@@ ity.
Elimination:
Only dic
an appro@@ xim@@ ate 3% of the dose of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant is elimin@@ ated in the urine, while approximately 8@@ 6% of the dose is excreted in the faec@@ es as unchanged drug and metabolit@@ es.
M@@ e
9 Special Po@@ pul@@ ations Race:
In sing@@ le@@ - and repeat-dose studies, the Cmax and AUC of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant were similar in healthy J@@ ap@@ ane@@ se
d and C@@ a@@ u@@ ca@@ si@@ an subjects, whe@@ re@@ as elimination half-life was shor@@ ter in J@@ ap@@ ane@@ se subjects (@@ 3-@@ 4 da@@ y@@ s) compared to C@@ a@@ u@@ ca@@ si@@ an subjects (@@ about 9 da@@ y@@ s).
The difference in half-life was due to differences in
ise peripheral volume of distribution as a consequence of lower weight in J@@ ap@@ ane@@ se subjects.
B@@ lack patients may have up to a 3@@ 1% lower Cmax and a 4@@ 3% lower AUC than patients of other rac@@ es.
Gender:
or The pharmacokinetics of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant are similar in female and male patients.
Elderly:
ut@@ h Elderly patients have s@@ ligh@@ tly higher exposure than young patients.
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis (@@ age range 18 - 81 years) a 75 year old patient is estimated to have a 2@@ 1% higher Cmax and a 27% higher AUC than a 40 year old patient.
r@@ a Patients with hepatic insuffici@@ ency@@ :
M@@ ild hepatic impairment does not alter ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant expo@@ sure.
D@@ at@@ a are insufficient to draw conclusions regarding pharmacokinetics in moderate hepatic impairment.
Patients with severe hepatic impairment were not evalu@@ ated.
ge Patients with renal impairment:
The effect of renal function on the pharmacokinetics of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant has not been studied specific@@ all@@ y. l@@ on Based on data from population pharmacokinetic studies, mild renal impairment do not see@@ m to affect the pharmacokinetics of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant.
Limited data suggest an increased exposure in patients with moderate renal impairment (@@ 40% increase in AU@@ C@@ ).
There are no data in severe renal impairment.
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as fol@@ low@@ s:
Con@@ vul@@ sions were observed spor@@ a@@ dic@@ ally in studies in ro@@ d@@ ents and mac@@ a@@ qu@@ es.
No convul@@ sions were c@@ t
observed in dogs during a 3 month study.
In som@@ e, but not all cases, initiation of convul@@ sions appeared to be associated with procedur@@ al st@@ re@@ ss such as handling of the an@@ im@@ al@@ s.
A pro@@ convul@@ s@@ ant activity of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant was found in one of two safety pharmac@@ ology studies.
No adverse effect of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant d@@ u
treatment was observed on E@@ E@@ G p@@ at@@ tern@@ s in rat@@ s.
Increased incidence and/ or sever@@ ity of clinical signs sugges@@ tive of increased t@@ ac@@ ti@@ le hy@@ pe@@ re@@ s@@ the@@ sia were r@@ o
observed in ro@@ d@@ ent studies.
A direct effect of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant cannot be r@@ ul@@ ed out.
in the rat@@ .
In standard fertility studies in female rats (@@ dosing for 2 weeks prior to m@@ atin@@ g) there was abnormal ina
o@@ est@@ rou@@ s cyc@@ l@@ icity and a decrease in cor@@ por@@ a l@@ ut@@ e@@ a and fertility in@@ de@@ x at doses of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant that induced maternal toxicity (30 and 60 mg/ kg/ day).
Following dosing for a longer treatment duration prior to m@@ ating (@@ 9 weeks) that per@@ mitted recover@@ y from the initial effects of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant, no adverse effects were seen on fertility or o@@ est@@ rou@@ s cyc@@ lic@@ ity.
Re@@ g@@ ar@@ ding reproductive parame@@ ter@@ s, at 30 mg/ kg no dic
differences were observed between treated animals and control@@ s, at 60 mg/ kg effects were sti@@ l@@ l observed (@@ decreased number of cor@@ por@@ a l@@ ut@@ e@@ a, im@@ pl@@ ant@@ ations, total and vi@@ able f@@ et@@ use@@ s).
S@@ por@@ a@@ dic m@@ alf@@ or@@ m@@ ations (@@ an@@ ence@@ ph@@ al@@ y, micro@@ -@@ oph@@ th@@ al@@ m@@ ia, w@@ iden@@ ed brain ventric@@ les and om@@ ph@@ al@@ oc@@ el@@ e) M@@ e
were observed in the rabb@@ it emb@@ r@@ y@@ of@@ et@@ al toxicity studies at doses resulting in exposures comparable with the clinical expo@@ sure@@ s.
Although maternal toxicity was observed at these doses, a rel@@ ation to treatment cannot be excluded.
No treatment@@ -related m@@ alf@@ or@@ m@@ ations were seen in the rat@@ .
10 Effects of ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ -@@ n@@ at@@ al development were assessed in the ra@@ t at doses up to 10 mg/ kg/ day.
There was a treatment related increase in p@@ up mortality in the pre-@@ we@@ an@@ ing period.
The increased p@@ up mortality might be attributable to a failure of the da@@ m to nurse or ing@@ es@@ tion of
d ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant in milk and/ or in@@ hib@@ i@@ tion of the su@@ ck@@ ling refle@@ x that is reported in the literature to be initiated in ne@@ on@@ at@@ al mic@@ e by endo@@ can@@ n@@ ab@@ in@@ o@@ id sign@@ all@@ ing via C@@ B@@ 1 receptors.

The potential relevance of this to administration of a C@@ B@@ 1 antagonist is unknown.
In the pre@@ - and post@@ -@@ n@@ at@@ al development study in rats, exposure to ri@@ mon@@ ab@@ ant in ut@@ er@@ o and via lactation produced no al@@ ter@@ ations on le@@ ar@@ ning or mem@@ or@@ y, but equiv@@ oc@@ al effects on motor

What is A@@ c@@ to@@ s@@ ?
A@@ c@@ to@@ s is a medicine containing the active substance p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ on@@ e.
The whit@@ e, round tablets contain 15@@ , 30 or 45 mg of p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ on@@ e.
What is A@@ c@@ to@@ s used for?
A@@ c@@ to@@ s is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as n@@ on in@@ su@@ lin@@ -@@ dependent diabet@@ es). • It can be used on its own (@@ mono@@ therap@@ y) in patients (@@ particularly those who are over@@ weigh@@ t@@ ) who cannot use me@@ t@@ form@@ in (@@ an anti@@ diabetic medicin@@ e). • It can be used t@@ og@@ e@@ ther with one other anti@@ diabetic medicine (@@ du@@ al therap@@ y).
It can be ad@@ ded to me@@ t@@ form@@ in in patients (@@ particularly those who are over@@ weigh@@ t@@ ) who are not sati@@ sfact@@ or@@ ily controlled on me@@ t@@ form@@ in used on its own and at the maximum toler@@ ated dose.
Alternatively, it can be ad@@ ded to a sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a (another anti@@ diabetic medicine) in patients for whom me@@ t@@ form@@ in is not suitable and who are not sati@@ sfact@@ or@@ ily controlled with the sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a used on its own at the maximum toler@@ ated dose. • It can be used t@@ og@@ e@@ ther with two other anti@@ diabetic medicines, me@@ t@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a, as t@@ rip@@ le therapy in patients (@@ particularly those who are over@@ weigh@@ t@@ ) who are not sati@@ sfact@@ or@@ ily controlled with these two medicines. • It can be used t@@ og@@ e@@ ther with in@@ sul@@ in in patients who are not sati@@ sfact@@ or@@ ily controlled with in@@ sul@@ in alone and cannot take me@@ t@@ for@@ min@@ .
How is A@@ c@@ to@@ s used?
A@@ c@@ to@@ s is taken once daily with or without food.
The dose is adjusted to g@@ ive the b@@ est control.
The recommended starting dose is 15 mg or 30 mg once dail@@ y.
This dose may need to be increased after one or two weeks to up to 45 mg once dail@@ y.
In combination with me@@ t@@ for@@ min@@ , the current me@@ t@@ form@@ in dose can be continued when starting A@@ c@@ to@@ s treatment.
In combination with a sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a or in@@ su@@ lin@@ , the current sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a or in@@ sul@@ in dose can be continued when starting A@@ c@@ to@@ s treatment unless the patient has hypo@@ glycaemia (low blood gluco@@ se@@ ), when the dose of the sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a or in@@ sul@@ in should be decrease@@ d.
How does A@@ c@@ to@@ s work?

How has A@@ c@@ to@@ s been studied?
A@@ c@@ to@@ s has been studied in clinical pharmac@@ ology studies and in clinical trials.
Al@@ most 7@@ ,@@ 000 patients received A@@ c@@ to@@ s in all trials combin@@ ed.
The studies compared A@@ c@@ to@@ s to placebo (a du@@ mm@@ y treatment@@ ), or to other anti@@ diabetic medicines (@@ me@@ t@@ for@@ min@@ , gl@@ ic@@ l@@ a@@ z@@ ide@@ ).
Some studies also looked at combin@@ ing A@@ c@@ to@@ s with other anti@@ diabetic medicines (@@ sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ reas@@ , in@@ su@@ lin@@ , me@@ t@@ for@@ min@@ ).
Further studies also looked at long-term use of A@@ c@@ to@@ s.
In t@@ rip@@ le therapy, the effectiveness of A@@ c@@ to@@ s was studied in more than 1,@@ 400 patients who were receiving a combination of me@@ t@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a, to which was ad@@ ded either A@@ c@@ to@@ s or placebo for up to 3@@ .5 years.
The studies measured the level in the blood of a substance (@@ glycosylated haem@@ oglob@@ in, H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ ), which giv@@ es an indication of how well the blood glucose is controlle@@ d.
What benefit has A@@ c@@ to@@ s shown during the studies?
A@@ c@@ to@@ s led to a decrease in the level of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ , indicating that blood glucose levels had been reduced at doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.
D@@ o@@ ses below 15 mg were not effec@@ tive, and doses above 45 mg (@@ once daily) did not show additional benef@@ it.
A@@ c@@ to@@ s on its own was shown to be as effective as me@@ t@@ form@@ in and gl@@ ic@@ l@@ a@@ z@@ ide@@ .
In combin@@ ation, A@@ c@@ to@@ s showed that it improv@@ es the control obtained in type 2 diabetes when ad@@ ded to existing treatment.
At the end of the t@@ rip@@ le therapy study, the effect of ad@@ ding A@@ c@@ to@@ s to the existing treatment with me@@ t@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a was a 0.9@@ 4% reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels, while ad@@ ding placebo led to a 0.@@ 35@@ % reduc@@ tion.
In a s@@ m@@ all study examin@@ ing the combination of A@@ c@@ to@@ s and in@@ sul@@ in in 28@@ 9 patients, patients ad@@ ding A@@ c@@ to@@ s to in@@ sul@@ in had a 0.@@ 69% reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels after 6 month@@ s, compared to 0.@@ 14@@ % in those ad@@ ding placebo.
What is the risk associated with A@@ c@@ to@@ s@@ ?
The most common side effects with A@@ c@@ to@@ s are visual disturbance, upper respiratory tract infection (@@ cold@@ s), weight increase@@ , and hypoaesthesia (@@ decreased sensitivity to a stimul@@ us@@ ).
For the full list of all side effects reported with A@@ c@@ to@@ s, see the Package Leaflet.
A@@ c@@ to@@ s should not be used in people who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one or any of the other ingredi@@ ents, or in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (@@ high levels of ketones [@@ acid@@ s@@ ] in the blood@@ ).
Why has A@@ c@@ to@@ s been approved?
The comm@@ it@@ tee recommended that A@@ c@@ to@@ s be given marketing authorisation.
In monotherapy (@@ used on its ow@@ n@@ ), the comm@@ it@@ tee decided that A@@ c@@ to@@ s should be an alternative to the standard treatment, me@@ t@@ for@@ min@@ , to be used when patients cannot take me@@ t@@ for@@ min@@ .
Other information about A@@ c@@ to@@ s:
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Un@@ i@@ on, for A@@ c@@ to@@ s to Tak@@ ed@@ a Europe R & D C@@ ent@@ re Limited on 13 O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er 2@@ 000@@ .
The marketing authorisation was ren@@ e@@ w@@ ed on 13 O@@ c@@ to@@ b@@ er 200@@ 5.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
P@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one is indicated in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellit@@ us:
- in patients (@@ particularly over@@ weight patients) inadequately controlled by di@@ e@@ t and exer@@ ci@@ se
for whom me@@ t@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate because of contra@@ indications or intolerance
as du@@ al oral therapy in combination with
- me@@ t@@ for@@ min@@ , in patients (@@ particularly over@@ weight patients) with insufficient glyc@@ aem@@ ic
control d@@ es@@ pit@@ e maxim@@ al toler@@ ated dose of monotherapy with me@@ t@@ form@@ in
- a sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a, only in patients who show intolerance to me@@ t@@ form@@ in or for whom
me@@ t@@ form@@ in is contra@@ indicat@@ ed, with insufficient glyc@@ aem@@ ic control d@@ es@@ pit@@ e maxim@@ al toler@@ ated dose of monotherapy with a sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a.
as t@@ rip@@ le oral therapy in combination with
- me@@ t@@ form@@ in and a sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a, in patients (@@ particularly over@@ weight patients) with insufficient
glyc@@ aem@@ ic control d@@ es@@ pit@@ e du@@ al oral therapy.
P@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one is also indicated for combination with in@@ sul@@ in in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with insufficient glyc@@ aem@@ ic control on in@@ sul@@ in for whom me@@ t@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate because of contra@@ indications or intolerance (see section 4.4).
4.2 Posology and method of administration
P@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one tablets are taken orally once daily with or without food.
P@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one may be initiated at 15@@ mg or 30@@ mg once dail@@ y.
The dose may be increased in increments up to 45@@ mg once dail@@ y.
2 In combination with in@@ su@@ lin@@ , the current in@@ sul@@ in dose can be continued upon initiation of p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one therapy.
If patients repor@@ t hypo@@ glyc@@ aemia, the dose of in@@ sul@@ in should be decrease@@ d.
Elderly:
No dosage adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (see section 5.2).
Patients with renal impairment:
No dosage adjustment is necessary in patients with impaired renal function (@@ creatinine clearance > 4 ml/ min@@ ) (see section 5.2).
No information is available from di@@ alysed patients therefore p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one should not be used in such patients.
Patients with hepatic impairment:
P@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.4).
Children and adolescents:
There are no data available on the use of p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one in patients under 18 years of age, and therefore its use is not recommended in this age group.
4.3 Contraindications
P@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one is contraindicated in patients with@@ :
- hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients
- cardiac failure or history of cardiac failure (@@ N@@ Y@@ H@@ A stag@@ es I to I@@ V@@ )
- hepatic impairment
- diabetic ketoacido@@ sis.
4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use
Flu@@ id retention and cardiac fail@@ ure:
P@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one can cause fluid retention, which may ex@@ ac@@ er@@ b@@ ate or precipit@@ ate heart failure.
When treating patients who have at least one risk factor for development of congestive heart failure (e. g. prior myocardial infarction or symptomatic cor@@ on@@ ary arter@@ y disease@@ ), physicians should start with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradu@@ all@@ y.
Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or oedema particularly those with reduced cardiac re@@ ser@@ v@@ e.
There have been cases of cardiac failure reported from the mar@@ ke@@ t when p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one was used in combination with in@@ su@@ lin@@ or in patients with a history of cardiac fail@@ ure@@ ; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema when p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one is used in combination with in@@ su@@ lin@@ .
Since in@@ sul@@ in and p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one are associated with fluid retention, concomitant administration may increase the risk of oedem@@ a.
P@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one should be discontinued if any deter@@ i@@ or@@ ation in cardiac status occurs.
A cardiovascular outcome study of p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one has been performed in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing major mac@@ ro@@ vascular disease.
P@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one or placebo was ad@@ ded to existing anti@@ diabetic and cardiovascular therapy for up to 3@@ .5 years.
This study showed an increase in reports of heart failure, ho@@ wever this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study.
C@@ a@@ ution should be exercised in patients over 75 years because of the limited experience in this patient group.
3 M@@ on@@ it@@ oring of liver func@@ tion:
There have been rare reports of he@@ p@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular dy@@ sf@@ un@@ ction during post-marketing experience (see section 4.8).
It is recommen@@ de@@ d, the@@ refore, that patients treated with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one undergo peri@@ odic monitoring of liver enzymes.
L@@ iv@@ er enzymes should be chec@@ ked prior to the initiation of therapy with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one in all patients.
Therap@@ y with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one should not be initiated in patients with increased baseline liver enzym@@ e levels (@@ AL@@ T > 2@@ .5 X upper limit of normal@@ ) or with any other evidence of liver disease.
Following initiation of therapy with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one, it is recommended that liver enzymes be monitored periodically based on clinical ju@@ dg@@ ement@@ .
If AL@@ T levels are increased to 3 X upper limit of normal during p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one therapy, liver enzym@@ e levels should be re@@ assessed as soon as possib@@ le.
If AL@@ T levels remain > 3 X the upper limit of normal, therapy should be discontinued.
If any patient develops symptoms suggesting hepatic dy@@ sf@@ unc@@ tion, which may include unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, anorex@@ ia and/ or d@@ ar@@ k urine, liver enzymes should be chec@@ k@@ ed.
The decision whether to continue the patient on therapy with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one should be gu@@ ided by clinical ju@@ dg@@ ement pen@@ ding laboratory evalu@@ ations.
If jaun@@ di@@ ce is obser@@ ve@@ d, drug therapy should be discontinued.
Weight gain:
In clinical trials with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one there was evidence of dose related weight gain, which may be due to fat accumulation and in some cases associated with fluid re@@ ten@@ tion.
In some cases weight increase may be a symptom of cardiac failure, therefore weight should be closely monitored.
P@@ art of the treatment of diabetes is di@@ et@@ ary control.
Patients should be advised to ad@@ h@@ ere stric@@ tly to a cal@@ or@@ i@@ e@@ -controlled diet.
Haem@@ at@@ olog@@ y:
There was a s@@ m@@ all reduction in mean haemoglobin (@@ 4% relative reduc@@ tion@@ ) and haematocrit (@@ 4.@@ 1% relative reduc@@ tion@@ ) during therapy with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one, consistent with haemodi@@ lu@@ tion.
Sim@@ il@@ ar changes were seen in me@@ t@@ form@@ in (haemoglobin 3 - 4% and haematocrit 3.@@ 6 – 4.@@ 1% relative reduc@@ tion@@ s) and to a l@@ es@@ se@@ r extent sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a and in@@ sul@@ in (haemoglobin 1 – 2% and haematocrit 1 – 3.2% relative reduc@@ tion@@ s) treated patients in comparative controlled trials with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ on@@ e.
Hy@@ po@@ glycaemia
As a consequence of increased in@@ sul@@ in sensi@@ tiv@@ ity, patients receiving p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one in du@@ al or t@@ rip@@ le oral therapy with a sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a or in du@@ al therapy with in@@ sul@@ in may be at risk for dose@@ -related hypo@@ glyc@@ aemia, and a reduction in the dose of the sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a or in@@ sul@@ in may be necessary.
Eye disorders:
Post@@ -marketing reports of ne@@ w@@ -@@ onset or worsening diabetic mac@@ ular oedema with decreased visual ac@@ u@@ ity have been reported with th@@ ia@@ zol@@ id@@ in@@ edi@@ on@@ es, including p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ on@@ e.
M@@ any of these patients reported conc@@ ur@@ rent peripheral oedem@@ a.
It is unclear whether or not there is a direct association between p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one and mac@@ ular oedema but presc@@ rib@@ ers should be al@@ er@@ t to the possibility of mac@@ ular oedema if patients repor@@ t disturb@@ ances in visual ac@@ u@@ it@@ y; an appropriate oph@@ th@@ al@@ m@@ ological ref@@ er@@ ral should be considered.
O@@ ther@@ s:
An increased incidence in bone f@@ r@@ act@@ ures in women was seen in a po@@ ol@@ ed analysis of adverse ev@@ ent reports of bone f@@ r@@ act@@ ure from randomised, controlled, doub@@ le b@@ lin@@ d clinical trials in over 8@@ 100 p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one and 7@@ 400 compar@@ ator treated patients, on treatment for up to 3@@ .5 years.
F@@ r@@ act@@ ures were observed in 2.@@ 6% of women taking p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one compared to 1.7% of women treated with a compar@@ ator@@ .
No increase in f@@ r@@ act@@ ure rates was observed in men treated with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one (@@ 1.@@ 3@@ %) ver@@ su@@ s compar@@ ator (@@ 1.@@ 5@@ %).
4 The f@@ r@@ act@@ ure incidence calculated was 1.@@ 9 f@@ r@@ act@@ ures per 100 patient years in women treated with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one and 1.@@ 1 f@@ r@@ act@@ ures per 100 patient years in women treated with a compar@@ ator@@ .
The observed excess risk of f@@ r@@ act@@ ures for women in this dat@@ ase@@ t on p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one is therefore 0.8 f@@ r@@ act@@ ures per 100 patient years of use.
In the 3@@ .5 year cardiovascular risk PRO@@ active study, 4@@ 4/ 8@@ 70 (@@ 5.1@@ %@@ ; 1.0 f@@ r@@ act@@ ures per 100 patient years) of p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ on@@ e-treated female patients experienced f@@ r@@ act@@ ures compared to 2@@ 3/ 9@@ 05 (2@@ .@@ 5@@ %@@ ; 0.5 f@@ r@@ act@@ ures per 100 patient years) of female patients treated with compar@@ ator@@ .
No increase in f@@ r@@ act@@ ure rates was observed in men treated with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one (@@ 1.@@ 7@@ %) ver@@ su@@ s compar@@ ator (2@@ .@@ 1@@ %).
The risk of f@@ r@@ act@@ ures should be considered in the long term care of women treated with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ on@@ e.
As a consequence of enh@@ anc@@ ing in@@ sul@@ in ac@@ tion, p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one treatment in patients with polycy@@ s@@ tic ov@@ ar@@ i@@ an syn@@ drome may result in re@@ su@@ m@@ ption of ov@@ ul@@ ation.
These patients may be at risk of pregnancy.
Patients should be a@@ w@@ are of the risk of pregnancy and if a patient w@@ i@@ sh@@ es to become pregnant or if pregnancy occurs, the treatment should be discontinued (see section 4.@@ 6@@ ).
P@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one should be used with caution during concomitant administration of cyto@@ chro@@ me P@@ 450 2C@@ 8 inhibitors (e. g. g@@ em@@ fibro@@ z@@ il@@ ) or inducers (e. g. ri@@ fam@@ p@@ ic@@ in).
Glyc@@ aem@@ ic control should be monitored clo@@ sely.
P@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one dose adjustment within the recommended pos@@ ology or changes in diabetic treatment should be considered (see section 4.5).
A@@ c@@ to@@ s tablets contain lactose monohydrate and therefore should not be administered to patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the L@@ ap@@ p lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose mal@@ absorption.
4.5 Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Interaction studies have shown that p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one has no relevant effect on either the pharmacokinetics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynam@@ ic@@ s of di@@ go@@ x@@ in, warfar@@ in, phen@@ pro@@ c@@ ou@@ mon and me@@ t@@ for@@ min@@ .
Co@@ -@@ administration of p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one with sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ as does not appear to affect the pharmacokinetics of the sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a.
Studies in ma@@ n suggest no induc@@ tion of the main induc@@ ib@@ le cyto@@ chro@@ me P@@ 4@@ 50@@ , 1@@ A, 2C@@ 8@@ / 9 and 3A@@ 4.
In vitro studies have shown no in@@ hib@@ i@@ tion of any sub@@ type of cyto@@ chro@@ me P@@ 4@@ 50@@ .
Inter@@ actions with subst@@ ances metabolised by these enzym@@ es, e. g. oral contrace@@ p@@ tiv@@ es, cyclosporin, calcium ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l block@@ ers, and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ tase inhibitors are not to be expected.
Co@@ -@@ administration of p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one with g@@ em@@ fibro@@ z@@ il (@@ an inhibitor of cyto@@ chro@@ me P@@ 450 2C@@ 8@@ ) is reported to result in a 3-@@ fol@@ d increase in AUC of p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ on@@ e.
Since there is a potential for an increase in dose@@ -related adverse events, a decrease in the dose of p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one may be nee@@ ded when g@@ em@@ fibro@@ z@@ il is concomitantly administ@@ e@@ red.
Close monitoring of glyc@@ aem@@ ic control should be considered (see section 4.4).
Co@@ - administration of p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one with ri@@ fam@@ p@@ ic@@ in (@@ an inducer of cyto@@ chro@@ me P@@ 450 2C@@ 8@@ ) is reported to result in a 5@@ 4% decrease in AUC of p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ on@@ e.
The p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one dose may need to be increased when ri@@ fam@@ p@@ ic@@ in is concomitantly administ@@ e@@ red.
Close monitoring of glyc@@ aem@@ ic control should be considered (see section 4.4).
4.6 Pregnancy and lactation
Use in pregnanc@@ y:
F@@ o@@ et@@ al growth re@@ stric@@ tion was apparent in animal studies with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ on@@ e.
This was attributable to the action of p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one in di@@ mini@@ shing the maternal hyper@@ in@@ su@@ lin@@ aemia and increased in@@ sul@@ in resi@@ st@@ ance that occurs during pregnancy there@@ by reducing the avail@@ ability of metabolic substrates for foetal g@@ row@@ th@@ .
The relevance of such a mechanism in humans is unclear and p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one should not be used in pregnancy.
5 Use in breast-f@@ eed@@ ing:
P@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one has been shown to be present in the milk of lactating rat@@ s.
It is not known whether p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one is secre@@ ted in human milk@@ .
Therefore, p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one should not be administered to breast-feeding women.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No effects on ability to drive and use machines have been observed.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Adverse reactions reported in excess (> 0.@@ 5@@ %) of placebo and as more than an isolated case in patients receiving p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one in double-blind studies are listed below as M@@ ed@@ D@@ R@@ A preferred term by system org@@ an cl@@ ass and absolute frequ@@ enc@@ y.

PO@@ ST@@ -M@@ AR@@ KE@@ TING D@@ AT@@ A
Eye disorders M@@ ac@@ ular oedem@@ a: not known
8 O@@ edem@@ a was reported in 6 – 9% of patients treated with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one over one year in controlled clinical trials.
The oedema rates for compar@@ ator groups (@@ sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a, me@@ t@@ for@@ min@@ ) were 2 – 5@@ %.
The reports of oedema were generally mild to moderate and usually did not require discontinuation of treatment.
In active compar@@ ator controlled trials mean weight increase with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one given as monotherapy was 2 – 3 kg over one year@@ .
This is similar to that seen in a sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a active compar@@ ator group.
In combination trials p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one ad@@ ded to me@@ t@@ form@@ in resulted in mean weight increase over one year of 1.5 kg and ad@@ ded to a sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a of 2.@@ 8 k@@ g.
In compar@@ ator groups addition of sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a to me@@ t@@ form@@ in resulted in a mean weight gain of 1.3 kg and addition of me@@ t@@ form@@ in to a sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a a mean weight loss of 1.0 k@@ g.
V@@ i@@ sual disturb@@ ance has been reported main@@ ly early in treatment and is related to changes in blood glucose due to tempor@@ ary al@@ ter@@ ation in the tur@@ g@@ id@@ ity and ref@@ r@@ active in@@ de@@ x of the l@@ en@@ s as seen with other hypo@@ glyc@@ aem@@ ic agents.
In clinical trials with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one the incidence of el@@ ev@@ ations of AL@@ T greater than three times the upper limit of normal was equal to placebo but less than that seen in me@@ t@@ form@@ in or sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a compar@@ ator group@@ s.
Me@@ an levels of liver enzymes decreased with treatment with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ on@@ e.
R@@ are cases of elevated liver enzymes and he@@ p@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular dy@@ sf@@ un@@ ction have occurred in post-marketing experi@@ ence@@ .
Although in very rare cases fatal outcome has been repor@@ ted, ca@@ us@@ al relationship has not been established.
In controlled clinical trials the incidence of reports of heart failure with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one treatment was the same as in placebo, me@@ t@@ form@@ in and sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a treatment group@@ s, but was increased when used in combination therapy with in@@ su@@ lin@@ .
In an outcome study of patients with pre-existing major mac@@ ro@@ vascular disease, the incidence of serious heart failure was 1.@@ 6% higher with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one than with placebo, when ad@@ ded to therapy that included in@@ su@@ lin@@ .
However, this did not lead to an increase in mortality in this study.
H@@ e@@ art failure has been reported rarely with marketing use of p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one, but more frequently when p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one was used in combination with in@@ sul@@ in or in patients with a history of cardiac failure.
A po@@ ol@@ ed analysis was conducted of adverse ev@@ ent reports of bone f@@ r@@ act@@ ures from randomised, compar@@ ator controlled, doub@@ le b@@ lin@@ d clinical trials in over 8@@ 100 patients in the p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ on@@ e-treated groups and 7@@ 400 in the compar@@ ator@@ -treated groups of up to 3@@ .5 years dur@@ ation.
A higher rate of f@@ r@@ act@@ ures was observed in women taking p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one (2@@ .@@ 6@@ %) ver@@ su@@ s compar@@ ator (@@ 1.@@ 7@@ %).
No increase in f@@ r@@ act@@ ure rates was observed in men treated with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one (@@ 1.@@ 3@@ %) ver@@ su@@ s compar@@ ator (@@ 1.@@ 5@@ %).
In the 3@@ .5 year PRO@@ active study, 4@@ 4/ 8@@ 70 (@@ 5.1@@ %) of p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ on@@ e-treated female patients experienced f@@ r@@ act@@ ures compared to 2@@ 3/ 9@@ 05 (2@@ .@@ 5@@ %) of female patients treated with compar@@ ator@@ .
No increase in f@@ r@@ act@@ ure rates was observed in men treated with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one (@@ 1.@@ 7@@ %) ver@@ su@@ s compar@@ ator (2@@ .@@ 1@@ %).
4.9 Overdose
Patients have taken p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one at higher than the recommended highest dose of 45 mg dail@@ y.
The maximum reported dose of 120 mg/ day for four da@@ ys, then 180 mg/ day for se@@ ven days was not associated with any symptoms.
Hy@@ po@@ glycaemia may occur in combination with sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ as or in@@ su@@ lin@@ .
Sy@@ mptom@@ atic and general supportive measures should be taken in case of overdose.

At two year@@ s, glyc@@ aem@@ ic control (@@ defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c < 8.@@ 0@@ %) was sustained in 69% of patients treated with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one, compared with 5@@ 0% of patients on gl@@ ic@@ l@@ a@@ z@@ ide@@ .
In a t@@ w@@ o@@ -@@ year study of combination therapy comparing p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one with gl@@ ic@@ l@@ a@@ z@@ ide when ad@@ ded to me@@ t@@ for@@ min@@ , glyc@@ aem@@ ic control measured as mean change from baseline in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was similar between treatment groups after one year@@ .
The rate of deter@@ i@@ or@@ ation of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c during the second year was less with p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one than with gl@@ ic@@ l@@ a@@ z@@ ide@@ .
In a placebo controlled trial, patients with in@@ adequate glyc@@ aem@@ ic control d@@ es@@ pit@@ e a three month in@@ sul@@ in optim@@ isation period were random@@ ised to p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one or placebo for 12 month@@ s.
Patients receiving p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one had a mean reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c of 0.@@ 4@@ 5% compared with those continuing on in@@ sul@@ in alon@@ e, and a reduction of in@@ sul@@ in dose in the p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one treated group.
H@@ O@@ M@@ A analysis show@@ s that p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one improv@@ es bet@@ a cell function as well as increasing in@@ sul@@ in sensi@@ tiv@@ ity.
T@@ w@@ o@@ -@@ year clinical studies have shown maintenance of this effec@@ t.
In one year clinical trials, p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one consi@@ st@@ ently g@@ a@@ ve a statistically significant reduction in the albumin@@ / creatinine ratio compared to base@@ line.
The effect of p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one (@@ 45 mg monotherapy v@@ s. placebo@@ ) was studied in a s@@ m@@ all 18@@ -week trial in type 2 diab@@ etic@@ s.
P@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one was associated with significant weight gain.
V@@ isc@@ eral fat was significantly decreased, while there was an increase in extra@@ -@@ abdominal fat m@@ as@@ s.
Sim@@ il@@ ar changes in body fat distribution on p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one have been accompanied by an improvement in in@@ sul@@ in sensi@@ tiv@@ ity.
In most clinical trials, reduced total plasma tri@@ glyc@@ er@@ id@@ es and f@@ ree f@@ att@@ y acid@@ s, and increased H@@ D@@ L@@ -@@ ch@@ ol@@ est@@ er@@ ol levels were observed as compared to placebo, with small@@ , but not clinically significant increases in L@@ D@@ L@@ -@@ ch@@ ol@@ est@@ er@@ ol level@@ s.
In clinical trials of up to two years duration, p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one reduced total plasma tri@@ glyc@@ er@@ id@@ es and f@@ ree f@@ att@@ y acid@@ s, and increased H@@ DL ch@@ ol@@ est@@ er@@ ol levels, compared with placebo, me@@ t@@ form@@ in or gl@@ ic@@ l@@ a@@ z@@ ide@@ .
P@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one did not cause statistically significant increases in L@@ DL ch@@ ol@@ est@@ er@@ ol levels compared with placebo, whilst reductions were observed with me@@ t@@ form@@ in and gl@@ ic@@ l@@ a@@ z@@ ide@@ .
In a 20@@ -week study, as well as reducing f@@ as@@ ting tri@@ glyc@@ er@@ id@@ es, p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one reduced pos@@ t p@@ ran@@ di@@ al hyper@@ tri@@ glyc@@ er@@ id@@ aemia through an effect on both absorbed and hepati@@ c@@ ally syn@@ the@@ si@@ sed tri@@ glyc@@ er@@ id@@ es.
These effects were in@@ dependent of p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ on@@ e’ s effects on glycaemia and were statistically significant different to g@@ li@@ b@@ enc@@ l@@ am@@ ide@@ .
In PRO@@ ac@@ tive, a cardiovascular outcome study, 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing major mac@@ ro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ised to p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one or placebo in addition to existing anti@@ diabetic and cardiovascular therapy, for up to 3@@ .5 years.
The study population had an a@@ ver@@ age age of 62 years; the a@@ ver@@ age duration of diabetes was 9.5 years.
Ap@@ pro@@ ximately one th@@ ir@@ d of patients were receiving in@@ sul@@ in in combination with me@@ t@@ form@@ in and/ or a sulph@@ on@@ y@@ lu@@ re@@ a.
To be el@@ ig@@ ib@@ le patients had to have had one or more of the fol@@ low@@ ing: myocardial infarction, stroke, per@@ cutaneous cardiac inter@@ ven@@ tion or cor@@ on@@ ary arter@@ y b@@ yp@@ ass gra@@ f@@ t, acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome, cor@@ on@@ ary arter@@ y disease, or peripheral arterial ob@@ str@@ u@@ c@@ tive disease.
Al@@ most half of the patients had a previous myocardial infarction and approximately 2@@ 0% had had a stroke.
Ap@@ pro@@ ximately half of the study population had at least two of the cardiovascular history ent@@ ry cr@@ it@@ er@@ ia.
Al@@ most all subjects (@@ 9@@ 5@@ %) were receiving cardiovascular medications (@@ bet@@ a block@@ ers, AC@@ E inhibitors, ang@@ io@@ ten@@ s@@ in II antagon@@ ist@@ s, calcium ch@@ an@@ ne@@ l block@@ ers, n@@ it@@ rat@@ es, di@@ ure@@ tic@@ s, as@@ pir@@ in, st@@ atin@@ s, fi@@ b@@ rat@@ es).
10 Although the study failed regarding its primary end@@ po@@ in@@ t, which was a com@@ posit@@ e of all@@ -@@ cause mortal@@ ity, n@@ on@@ - fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome, major le@@ g am@@ p@@ ut@@ ation, cor@@ on@@ ary re@@ v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and le@@ g re@@ v@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ is@@ ation, the results suggest that there are no long-term cardiovascular concerns regarding use of p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ on@@ e.
However, the inc@@ id@@ ences of oedema, weight gain and heart failure were increased.
No increase in mortality from heart failure was observed.
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties
Absorption:
Following oral administr@@ ation, p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one is rapidly absorbed, and peak plasma concentrations of unchanged p@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one are usually achieved 2 hours after administration.
Pro@@ por@@ tional increases of the plasma concentration were observed for doses from 2 – 60 mg.
S@@ te@@ ad@@ y state is achieved after 4@@ – 7 days of dosing.
R@@ ep@@ e@@ ated dosing does not result in accumulation of the comp@@ ound or metabolit@@ es.
Ab@@ sor@@ ption is not influ@@ enc@@ ed by food intake.
Ab@@ solute bioavailability is greater than 80@@ %.
Distribution:
The estimated volume of distribution in humans is 0.@@ 25 l/ k@@ g.
P@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one and all active metabolites are extensively bound to plasma protein (> 9@@ 9@@ %).
Metabolism:
P@@ i@@ og@@ lit@@ a@@ z@@ one undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism by hydroxylation of al@@ iph@@ atic me@@ th@@ ylene group@@ s.
This is predominantly via cyto@@ chro@@ me P@@ 450 2C@@ 8 although other iso@@ forms may be involved to a l@@ es@@ se@@ r de@@ gre@@ e.
